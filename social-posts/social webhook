The mission, designated VA267 and named Leo Europe 01 (LE-01) by Amazon, carried 32 satellites for Amazon’s Leo constellation—formerly known as Project Kuiper—marking the first time the company’s internet satellites rode aboard a European launcher.</p>\n<p>The Ariane 64, the most powerful variant of the Ariane 6 family, features four P120C solid rocket boosters—double the count of the earlier Ariane 62. This configuration, paired with a new 20-metre-long fairing, enabled the rocket to deliver its payload to a 465-kilometre low-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JLwvlp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">Earth</a> orbit inclined at 51.9 degrees. After separation, the satellites will raise their orbits to 630 km to join the growing Leo constellation, which now includes 212 operational satellites.</p>\n<p>This launch is the first of 18 contracted with Arianespace and introduces upgraded capabilities that will soon include the P160C booster, offering a 10% performance boost. With Amazon approved to expand its constellation to over 7,000 satellites, reliable access to space is critical. “These powerful launch vehicles allow us to deploy more satellites per mission, which will help us get service to customers as quickly as possible,” said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of Amazon Leo.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Upper_part_for_Ariane_6_flight_VA267_arriving_at_the_launch_pad-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Ariane 6 upper stage arriving at launch pad for VA267 mission\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>El Paso Airport Closure Sparks Confusion Over Anti-Drone Laser Test</h3>\n<p>In a mix-up that reads like a script from a satirical newsroom, El Paso International Airport was abruptly closed on the evening of February 11, 2026, only to reopen less than 10 hours later. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initially cited a “cartel drone incursion” as justification for grounding all flights up to 18,000 feet—a restriction that would have lasted 10 days. But reports soon suggested the real cause was a miscommunication surrounding a U.S. military anti-drone laser test from nearby Fort Bliss.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Ars Technica</em>, the military has been developing high-energy lasers to counter increasingly sophisticated drone surveillance by drug cartels along the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the FAA had not yet finalized safety protocols for such tests near civilian airspace. Despite that, the test reportedly went ahead, possibly targeting what turned out to be a harmless party balloon—an ironic twist that underscores the challenges of distinguishing threats in crowded skies.</p>\n<p>El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson called the closure “unacceptable,” emphasizing that local officials weren’t consulted. The incident highlights the growing tension between national security imperatives and civilian aviation safety, especially as drone technology proliferates globally—thanks in part to lessons from conflicts like the war in Ukraine. As one official might say over a well-deserved cup of coffee: “Next time, maybe check if it’s a balloon before shutting down an airport.”</p>\n\n<h3>Canadian Space Institute Expands Training Across North America</h3>\n<p>Canada’s emerging space sector is taking a continental leap with the North American Space Institute (NASI) announcing a strategic expansion into the United States. Founded in 2025 by former Canadian Space Agency technologist Michael Graham, NASI is Canada’s first dedicated space technician school, offering the certified Space Systems Technician (SST) program—recognized by the Canadian Council for Aviation and Aerospace (CCAA).</p>\n<p>On February 11, NASI revealed partnerships with U.S. firms Learning Exchange Inc (LEXX) and Alliance Cyber to align its curriculum with U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) 8140 workforce frameworks, which govern cybersecurity roles that increasingly intersect with space operations. The goal is to create a unified, interoperable standard for space technicians across North America, addressing what Graham calls a shortage of 58,000 qualified technicians.</p>\n<p>While the move signals ambition, it also raises practical questions about labour mobility, particularly given U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) that restrict foreign nationals—including Canadians—from accessing certain defence-related space work. NASI’s COO Aaron Topple acknowledged the complexities but remained optimistic, stating, “Space uniquely stands as a sector that bridges nations.” Even if regulatory hurdles remain, the effort reflects a growing recognition that Canada’s space workforce must be globally competitive—and ready on day one.</p>\n<img src=\"https://spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nasi.png\" alt=\"North American Space Institute logo and training facility\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Inaugural Ariane 64 to launch Amazon Leo satellites from Kourou\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2026/02/le-01-launch/\">https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2026/02/le-01-launch/</a></li>\n    <li>\"El Paso airport closed after military used new anti-drone laser to zap party balloon\" - <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/el-paso-airport-closed-after-military-used-new-anti-drone-laser-to-zap-party-balloon/\">https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/el-paso-airport-closed-after-military-used-new-anti-drone-laser-to-zap-party-balloon/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Canadian space institute targets continental workforce with US expansion\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/canadian-space-institute-targets-continental-workforce-with-us-expansion/\">https://spaceq.ca/canadian-space-institute-targets-continental-workforce-with-us-expansion/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px;\">\n  <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Upcoming Launches</h1>\n  <br>\n\n  <!-- CARD 1 -->\n  <div style=\"border: 3px solid; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; max-width: 450px; width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 8px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 0 10px;\">Starlink Group 17-34</h3>\n    <img src=\"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon_9_image_20230807133459.jpeg\" alt=\"Falcon 9\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 6px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin: 0; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;\">\n      <strong>Launch Provider:</strong> SpaceX - Commercial<br>\n      <strong>Launch Date:</strong> February 11, 2026<br>\n      <strong>Launch Time:</strong> 5:11 PM UTC<br>\n      <strong>Vehicle:</strong> Falcon 9<br>\n      <strong>Brief:</strong> A batch of 24 satellites for the Starlink mega-constellation - SpaceX's project for space-based Internet communication system.<br><br>\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K98Fp9-OOD8\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;\">🚀 Watch Livestream</a>\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n  <!-- CARD 2 -->\n  <div style=\"border: 3px solid; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; max-width: 450px; width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box; border-radius: 8px;\">\n    <h3 style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 0 10px;\">PRSC-EO2 & 6 satellites</h3>\n    <img src=\"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/smart_dragon_3__image_20240925074606.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Dragon 3\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 6px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin: 0; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;\">\n      <strong>Launch Provider:</strong> China Rocket Co.
