In this data visualization, the Moon moves from right to left, passing through Earth's shadow and leaving in its wake an eclipse diagram with the times (in UTC) at various stages of the eclipse. Credit: NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio A total lunar eclipse will redden the Moon in the early morning hours of March 3, 2026. Here’s what you need to know. How does a lunar eclipse work? A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth passes directly between the Sun and Moon, casting a gigantic shadow across the lunar surface and turning the Moon a deep reddish-orange. This alignment can only occur during a full Moon phase . Alignment of the Moon, Earth, and Sun during a lunar eclipse (not to scale). NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio How can I observe the eclipse? You can observe a lunar eclipse without any special equipment. All you need is a line of sight to the Moon! For a more dramatic observing experience, seek a dark environment away from bright lights. Binoculars or a telescope can also enhance your view.  On March 3, totality will be visible in the evening from eastern Asia and Australia, throughout the night in the Pacific, and in the early morning in North and Central America and far western South America. The eclipse is partial in central Asia and much of South America. No eclipse is visible in Africa or Europe. Map showing where the March 3, 2026 lunar eclipse is visible. Contours mark the edge of the visibility region at eclipse contact times, labeled in UTC. NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio What can I expect to see? Milestone: What's happening: Penumbral eclipse begins (12:44 a.m. PST, 3:44 a.m. EST, 8:44 UTC) The Moon enters the Earth’s penumbra, the outer part of the shadow. The Moon begins to dim, but the effect is quite subtle. Partial eclipse begins (1:50 a.m. PST, 4:50 a.m. EST, 9:50 UTC) The Moon begins to enter Earth’s umbra and the partial eclipse begins. To the naked eye, as the Moon moves into the umbra, it looks like a bite is being taken out of the lunar disk. The part of the Moon inside the umbra appears very dark. Totality begins (3:04 a.m. PST, 6:04 a.m. EST, 11:04 UTC) The entire Moon is now in the Earth’s umbra. The Moon is tinted a coppery red. Try binoculars or a telescope for a better view. If you want to take a photo, use a camera on a tripod with exposures of at least several seconds. Totality ends (4:03 a.m. PST, 7:03 a.m. EST, 12:03 UTC) As the Moon exits Earth’s umbra, the red color fades. It looks as if a bite is being taken out of the opposite side of the lunar disk from before. Partial eclipse ends (5:17 a.m. PST, 8:17 a.m. EST, 13:17 UTC) The whole Moon is in Earth’s penumbra, but again, the dimming is subtle. Penumbral eclipse ends (6:23 a.m. PST, 9:23 a.m. EST, 14:23 UTC) The eclipse is over. Why is a lunar eclipse sometimes called a “blood Moon”? During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon appears dark red or orange. This is because our planet blocks most of the Sun’s light from reaching the Moon, and the light that does reach the lunar surface is filtered through a thick slice of Earth’s atmosphere. It’s as if all of the world’s sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon.  Learn more: Why does the Moon turn red during a solar eclipse?

Credit: NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio What else can I observe on the night of the eclipse? As Earth's shadow dims the lunar surface, constellations may be easier to spot than they usually are during a full Moon. At the time of the eclipse, the Moon will be in the constellation Leo, under the lion's hind paws.  Several days later, on March 8, look for a “conjunction” of Venus and Saturn: from our perspective on Earth, these two planets will appear close to each other in the sky (though they’ll still be very distant from each other in space).

    "content": "In a new study, researchers say that non-biological sources they considered could not fully account for the abundance of organic compounds in a sample collected on Mars by NASA's Curiosity rover. In March 2025, scientists reported identifying small amounts of decane, undecane, and dodecane in a rock sample analyzed in the chemistry lab aboard Curiosity. These were the largest organic compounds found on Mars, with researchers hypothesizing that they could be fragments of fatty acids preserved in the ancient mudstone in Gale Crater. On Earth, fatty acids are produced mostly by life, though they can be made through geologic processes, too. It was not possible to determine from Curiosity's data alone whether or not the molecules they found were made by living things, which led to a follow-on study that evaluated known non-biological sources of these organic molecules - such as delivery by meteorites smashing into the Martian surface - to see if they could account for the amounts previously found. Reporting on Feb. 4 in the journal Astrobiology, researchers say that as the non-biological sources they considered could not fully explain the abundance of organic compounds, it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that living things could have formed them. To reach their conclusion, scientists combined lab radiation experiments, mathematical modeling, and Curiosity data to \"rewind the clock\" about 80 million years - the length of time the rock would have been exposed on the Martian surface. This allowed them to estimate how much organic material would have been present before being destroyed by long-term exposure to cosmic radiation: far more than typical non-biological processes could produce. The team says more study is needed to better understand how quickly organic molecules break down in Mars-like rock under Mars-like conditions - and before any conclusions can be reached about the absence or presence of life.",

    "content": "Four astronauts will blast off to re-staff the International Space Station (ISS) next week, NASA said Friday, after an emergency medical evacuation of the previous crew. Crew-12 will lift off on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket early Wednesday, the US space agency said, with launch time \"targeted for no earlier than 6:01 am\" local time (1101 GMT). The confirmation provides a sliver of certainty for the Crew-12 mission, which had faced last-minute rocket problems and staffing changes. Earlier this week, SpaceX had grounded its Falcon 9 rockets while investigating what the Federal Aviation Administration said was a \"stage 2 engine's failure to ignite.\" \"The Falcon 9 vehicle is authorized to return to flight,\" an FAA spokesman told AFP Friday. The temporary pause from SpaceX raised concerns the Crew-12 flight could have been delayed. The mission will be replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January, a month earlier than planned, during the first medical evacuation in the space station's history. The scientific laboratory, which orbits 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three. NASA has declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the mission short. Additionally, the mission's crew changed in November, when Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev was suddenly replaced by Andrey Fedyaev. Reports from independent media in Russia suggested Artemyev had been photographing and sending classified information with his phone. Russian space agency Roscosmos merely said he had been transferred to a different job. In addition to Fedyaev, Crew-12 comprises Americans Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway and French astronaut Sophie Adenot. Once the astronauts finally get on board, they will be one of the last crews to live on board the football field-sized space station. Continuously inhabited for the last quarter century, the ageing ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth's orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030. New crew set to launch for ISS after medical evacuation Paris, France (AFP) Feb 5, 2026 - Four astronauts could blast off to the International Space Station (ISS) next week, after setbacks including a mysterious medical evacuation of the previous crew, last-minute rocket problems, and some scheduling conflicts with NASA's Moon mission. The crew was scheduled to launch on February 11, Elon Musk's SpaceX company said this week it was grounding all flights on its Falcon 9 rocket while it investigates an unspecified issue. This late uncertainty is just the most recent twist for the SpaceX Crew-12 mission, which includes Americans Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev. They will be replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January, a month earlier than planned, during the first medical evacuation in the space station's history. NASA has declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the mission short. However, the scientific laboratory, which orbits 400 kilometres above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three. Because of the medical evacuation, NASA moved the date of the Crew-12 launch forward a few days. The launch had also overlapped with NASA's first mission to fly astronauts around the Moon in more than half a century. The launch window for the Artemis 2 mission had been set for February 6-11 -- until leaks detected this week during final tests pushed the date back to March 6. - 'One day, that will be me' - Once the astronauts finally get on board, they will be one of the last crews to live on board the football field-sized space station. Continuously inhabited for the last quarter century, the ageing ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth's orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030. The ISS, once a symbol of warming post-Cold War relations, has been a rare area of continued cooperation between the West and Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. However, the space station has not entirely avoided the tensions back on Earth. In November, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev -- who had long been planned to be a member of Crew-12 -- was suddenly taken off the mission. Reports from independent media in Russia suggested he had been photographing and sending classified information with his phone. Russian space agency Roscosmos merely said he had been transferred to a different job. His replacement Fedyaev, has already spent some time on the ISS as part of Crew-6 in 2023. During their eight months on the space station, the four astronauts will conduct many experiments, including research into the effects of microgravity on their bodies. Meir, who previously worked as a marine biologist studying animals in extreme environments, will serve as the crew's commander. Adenot will become the second French woman to fly to space, following in the footsteps of Claudie Haignere, who spent time on the Mir space station. When Adenot saw Haignere's mission blast off, she was 14 years old. \"It was a revelation,\" the helicopter pilot said recently. \"At that moment, I told myself: one day, that will be me.\" Among other research, the European Space Agency astronaut will test a system that uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to allow astronauts to carry out their own medical ultrasounds. The mission is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 1100 GMT on February 11. If called off, launches can also be attempted on the following two days.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON — NASA has selected two Earth science missions for development, one focused on studying the atmosphere and the other on terrestrial ecosystems and ice. The agency announced Feb. 5 that it chose the Stratosphere-Troposphere Response using Infrared Vertically resolved light Explorer, or STRIVE, and the Earth Dynamics Geodetic Explorer, or EDGE, as the first Earth System Explorer missions. Each is scheduled to launch no earlier than 2030. STRIVE, led by Lyatt Jaeglé of the University of Washington, will provide daily measurements of atmospheric temperature, composition and aerosol properties from the upper troposphere to the mesosphere. It will collect data using two instruments, an infrared imaging spectrometer and a near-infrared multidirectional radiometer, hosted on a Northrop Grumman LEOStar-2 satellite bus. EDGE, led by Helen Amanda Fricker of the University of California San Diego, will fly the first global satellite imaging laser altimeter system. The instrument will provide three-dimensional measurements of terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, and map surface features on glaciers and other icy terrain. EDGE will use a spacecraft bus provided by Lanteris Space Systems. STRIVE and EDGE were among four finalists selected by NASA in 2024 for one-year concept studies. The other two finalists were ODYSEA, a mission to study ocean surface currents and winds, and Carbon-I, a mission to measure greenhouse gases to better understand natural and human-caused emissions.

Save on SpaceNews NASA said in its fiscal year 2026 budget proposal last May that it would select only one Earth System Explorer mission, citing reduced budgets. Congress, however, largely rejected the proposed cuts to NASA science programs in a minibus spending bill passed last month. The missions are the first in NASA’s Earth System Explorer program, created in response to recommendations from the 2018 Earth science decadal survey. The decadal called for a line of competitively selected Earth science missions with higher cost caps than Earth Venture small satellites but lower costs than directed missions, focusing on measurements across seven science areas. When NASA announced the four finalists for the first Earth System Explorer call in 2024, it said that one of those seven areas, greenhouse gas measurements, would be prioritized. “As we continue to confront our changing climate and its impacts on humans and our environment, the need for data and scientific research could not be greater,” Nicky Fox, NASA associate administrator for science, said at the time. EDGE does not have the capability to study greenhouse gases, while STRIVE focuses on ozone and trace gases, including the ability to track global pollution and improve climate modeling. In announcing the final selections, Fox instead emphasized the missions’ relevance to human space exploration. “By understanding Earth’s surface topography, ecosystems and atmosphere, while also enabling longer-range weather forecasting, these missions will help us better study the extreme environments beyond our home planet to ensure the safety of astronauts and spacecraft as we return to the Moon with the Artemis campaign and journey onward to Mars and beyond,” she stated. STRIVE and EDGE will now proceed toward a confirmation review in 2027. If approved for full development, each mission will have a cost cap of $355 million, excluding launch costs. That represents an increase from the $310 million cap in place when NASA selected the four finalists in 2024.",

    "content": "Teams at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida continue to prepare the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, Orion spacecraft, and ground infrastructure in advance of the Artemis II test flight. Engineers have remained on track or ahead of schedule as they work through planned activities at the launch pad and are getting ready to conduct a wet dress rehearsal , leading up to a simulated “launch” as early as Saturday, Jan. 31. The upcoming wet dress rehearsal is a prelaunch test to fuel the rocket. During the rehearsal, teams demonstrate the ability to load more than 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellants into the rocket, conduct a launch countdown, and practice safely removing propellant from the rocket without astronauts inside the spacecraft. During several “runs,” the wet dress rehearsal will test the launch team’s ability to hold, resume, and recycle to several different times in the final 10 minutes of the countdown, known as terminal count. The rehearsal will count down to a simulated launch at 9 p.m. EST, but could run to approximately 1 a.m. if needed. The first run will begin approximately 49 hours before launch when launch teams are called to their stations, to 1 minute 30 seconds before launch, followed by a planned three-minute hold and then countdown resumption to 33 seconds before launch – the point at which the rocket’s automatic launch sequencer will control the final seconds of the countdown. Teams then will recycle back to T-10 minutes and hold, then resume down to 30 seconds before launch as part of a second run. If needed, NASA may rollback SLS and Orion to the Vehicle Assembly Building for additional work ahead of launch after the wet dress rehearsal. Over the weekend, teams successfully serviced the SLS rocket boosters, which involved loading hydrazine into the booster aft skirts. The team continues operations to prepare Orion for flight, including stowing items inside the spacecraft and performing planned pyrotechnic work on the launch abort system. Technicians performed checkouts of core stage’s four RS-25 engines and pressurized a tank in the spacecraft propulsion system used for fueling, called the composite overwrapped pressure vessel. With cold weather sweeping the country and lower than normal temperatures expected in Florida Tuesday, Jan. 27, technicians are taking steps to ensure environmental control systems keeping Orion and SLS elements at the proper conditions are prepared for the cold . Engineers and scientists also are addressing issues that cropped up during operations in preparation for crewed flight. During an evaluation of the emergency egress system , the baskets used to transport the crew and other pad personnel from the mobile launcher in an emergency stopped short of the terminus area located inside the pad perimeter. Since then, the brakes of the system have been adjusted to ensure the baskets fully descend. In the coming days, technicians also will take additional samples of Orion’s potable water system to ensure the crew’s water is drinkable. Initial samples showed higher levels of total organic carbon than expected. Crew also remain in quarantine in Houston, which they entered on Jan. 23.",

Technicians performed checkouts of core stage’s four RS-25 engines and pressurized a tank in the spacecraft propulsion system used for fueling, called the composite overwrapped pressure vessel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With cold weather sweeping the country and lower than normal temperatures expected in Florida Tuesday, Jan. 27, technicians are taking steps to ensure environmental control systems keeping Orion and SLS elements at the proper conditions are <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-ii-weather-criteria/\">prepared for the cold</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineers and scientists also are addressing issues that cropped up during operations in preparation for crewed flight. During an evaluation of the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/artemis-2/artemis-emergency-egress-system-emphasizes-crew-safety/\">emergency egress system</a>, the baskets used to transport the crew and other pad personnel from the mobile launcher in an emergency stopped short of the terminus area located inside the pad perimeter. Since then, the brakes of the system have been adjusted to ensure the baskets fully descend. In the coming days, technicians also will take additional samples of Orion’s potable water system to ensure the crew’s water is drinkable.&nbsp;Initial samples showed higher levels of total organic carbon than expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crew also remain in quarantine in Houston, which they entered on Jan. 23.</p>\n",
