The rockets, rovers, and spacecraft that make this exploration possible all rely on an invisible backbone. Communications. Every image, every discovery, every scientific breakthrough from another world needs to travel across hundreds of millions of kilometers back to Earth. Rocket Lab's Mars Telecommunications Orbiter (MTO) will enable this. It’s the invisible infrastructure that makes NASA’s entire Mars strategy possible. But why does Mars matter and why do we need to talk to it? **1. Without communications, Mars missions simply don’t work ** NASA’s Mars missions have transformed humanity's understanding of the Red Planet. Orbiters have mapped its surface in extraordinary detail. Rovers have found evidence of ancient lakes and rivers. The next generation of missions will go even further, including returning samples to Earth and paving the way for humans to live and work on Mars. But spacecraft and humans at Mars can’t send meaningful data directly back to Earth on their own. Rocket Lab's Mars Telecommunications Orbiter will be a vital relay, ensuring discoveries, images, and scientific breakthroughs actually make it home. **2. It protects billions of dollars already invested in Mars ** Taxpayers have funded decades of NASA Mars missions that have delivered globally significant Mars findings. The current Mars Relay Network that these missions rely on is fragile, aging, and limited. The recent loss of contact with the MAVEN is testament that time is running out to establish new and reliable communications at Mars. Without reliable communications, the flow of data from existing spacecraft at Mars could simply dry up. MTO ensures their continuity. ** 3. It multiplies the value of every Mars mission ** Rocket Lab's Mars Telecommunications Orbiter would support dozens of spacecraft, today and into the future, dramatically increasing how much science and value each mission delivers. Just one orbiter makes every Mars mission more powerful. **4. It enables future human missions to Mars ** NASA’s long-term Mars exploration strategy goes far beyond landing robots. It’s about enabling sustained exploration and ultimately, human missions. Humans on Mars will need constant communication with Earth for navigation, science operations, safety, coordination, and simple human connection. Reliable communications aren’t optional, they’re essential. Rocket Lab’s Mars Telecommunications Orbiter will be the reliable and enduring infrastructure that enables NASA’s human exploration goals at Mars. **5. It keeps America at the forefront of space leadership ** Space leadership isn’t just about getting there, it’s about building the enduring infrastructure that makes sustained exploration possible. Throughout history, exploration has depended on infrastructure. Ships enabled ocean crossings. Railroads opened continents. Satellites connected the globe. Communications infrastructure will define the next era of Mars exploration and America needs to be at the forefront. We recognize that the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter is a necessity, not an afterthought. It’s why Rocket Lab proposed an independently launched MTO as part of our Mars Sample Return Architecture.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

        "content": "**Long Beach, California. January 26, 2026** – Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the arrival of its “Hungry Hippo” captive fairing – a world-first for a commercial rocket – to Virginia for its Neutron rocket. After clearing qualification testing late last year, the Hungry Hippo has been delivered to Wallops Island in Virginia and transported to Rocket Lab’s Neutron Assembly and Integration Complex. In the coming days engineers and technicians will complete their inspections following its delivery and prepare the fairing for further pre-launch testing at Neutron’s nearby launch and test site, Rocket Lab Launch Complex 3. Hungry Hippo’s arrival marks another step toward Neutron’s debut that will usher in a new era of commercial space access. With a launch, return, and launch again ethos that mimics commercial aviation, Neutron will bring innovation and competition to today’s global space industry that strengthens America’s industrial base and ensures its access to space with reliable and modern launch capabilities. **Neutron “Hungry Hippo” key facts:** Neutron will be the world’s largest reusable carbon composite rocket, capable of launching up to 13,000 kg ( 33,000 pounds) of payload and cargo to space for missions involving national security, space science and human exploration, and constellation deployment for satellite internet, Earth observation, global connectivity, and more. With a focus on rapid reuse and reducing launch costs, Neutron’s “Hungry Hippo” fairing halves remain attached to the rocket throughout the entire mission, including launch, payload deployment, and return to Earth – a world-first for a reusable commercial rocket. Whereas typical rockets’ fairing halves fall away during launch and are disposable or require collection at sea for reuse, Neutron’s fairing halves open and close for second stage deployment within a matter of seconds - streamlining operations for a high-cadence launch service for commercial, civil, and national security missions. **Images: ** Neutron | Flickr **ENDS** **Rocket Lab Media Contact** Murielle Baker &#109;&#x65;&#100;&#x69;&#97;&#x40;&#114;&#x6f;&#99;&#x6b;&#101;&#x74;&#108;&#x61;&#98;&#x75;&#115;&#x61;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d; **About Rocket Lab **Rocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.
