The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues.</p>\n<p>“The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization.

The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added.</p>\n<p>Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022.</p>\n<p>Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket.</p>\n<p>Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments.</p>\n<p>Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack.<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-112152\" src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1560\" height=\"885\" srcset=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916.jpg 1560w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-350x199.jpg 350w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-617x350.jpg 617w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-1170x664.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1560px) 100vw, 1560px\">“Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed.</p>\n<aside class=\"penci-sidebar-content widget l2-info\"><h4 class=\"widget-title penci-border-arrow\"><span class=\"inner-arrow\">See Also</span></h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=48.0\">Artemis Section</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=37.0\">L2 Artemis</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/\">Click here to Join L2</a></li></ul></aside>\n<p>The vehicle remains in a safe configuration, relying on ground-based environmental control systems (ECS) for engine purging instead of the onboard helium supply.</p>\n<p>This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution.</p>\n<p>“A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.”</p>\n<p>NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad.</p>\n<p>The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.</p>\n<p><em>Lead photo: Tyler Gray for NSF.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.nasaspaceflight.com/pages/artemis-ii\"><img

The decision follows an unexpected interruption in helium flow within the rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS), observed overnight on Saturday, February 21, 2026. This issue with the ICPS has prompted teams to review data and prepare contingency measures, effectively ruling out the targeted March launch window and pushing the mission toward a possible April liftoff if the rollback is confirmed. Pre-rollback work is already underway, including the removal of pad access platforms installed yesterday. These platforms are subject to wind constraints and cannot be removed during high winds, which are forecasted for tomorrow. Following a successful second Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), NASA took the unusual step of announcing a target launch date of March 6 for Artemis II—despite traditionally waiting until the completion of the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) to set firm dates. Less than 24 hours later, that date became non-viable after an overnight helium flow anomaly was noted. Discover more NASA merchandise Chinese spaceflight analysis Space exploration books NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman addressed the development in a statement, emphasizing the troubleshooting efforts underway. “After overnight data showed an interruption in helium flow in the SLS interim cryogenic propulsion stage, teams are troubleshooting and preparing for a likely rollback of Artemis II to the VAB,” Isaacman said. “This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window.” Notably, NSF was hearing rumors of a potential vehicle issue that could result in a rollback on Saturday morning. Less than an hour later, NASA and Isaacman published a statement online—an impressive sign of the Administrator’s commitment to increasing transparency at the agency. The ICPS, or Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, is effectively the SLS rocket’s upper stage. Derived from the Delta IV rocket’s second stage and adapted for Artemis missions, it uses liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) as propellants to provide the necessary thrust after core stage burnout, enabling the Orion spacecraft to reach lunar orbit insertion trajectories. Helium plays a vital role in this system. Stored in onboard bottles, it purges the engines of residual gases and pressurizes the LH2 and LOX tanks during ascent. According to Isaacman, the ICPS helium system performed flawlessly during the first two Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs), which are full-scale fueling simulations conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues. “The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2,” he noted. The problem emerged during a routine repressurization operation last evening, catching teams off guard. “This was an unexpected development during routine helium flow operations last evening. The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added. Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022. Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket. Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments. Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed.

This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution. “A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.” NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad. The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.

Stored in onboard bottles, it purges the engines of residual gases and pressurizes the LH2 and LOX tanks during ascent.</p>\n<p>According to Isaacman, the ICPS helium system performed flawlessly during the first two Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs), which are full-scale fueling simulations conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues.</p>\n<p>“The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2,” he noted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem emerged during a routine repressurization operation last evening, catching teams off guard.</p>\n<p>“This was an unexpected development during routine helium flow operations last evening. The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added.</p>\n<p>Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022.</p>\n<p>Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket.</p>\n<p>Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments.</p>\n<p>Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack.<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-112152\" src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1560\" height=\"885\" srcset=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916.jpg 1560w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-350x199.jpg 350w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-617x350.jpg 617w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-1170x664.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1560px) 100vw, 1560px\">“Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed.</p>\n<aside class=\"penci-sidebar-content widget l2-info\"><h4 class=\"widget-title penci-border-arrow\"><span class=\"inner-arrow\">See Also</span></h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=48.0\">Artemis Section</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=37.0\">L2 Artemis</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/\">Click here to Join L2</a></li></ul></aside>\n<p>The vehicle remains in a safe configuration, relying on ground-based environmental control systems (ECS) for engine purging instead of the onboard helium supply.</p>\n<p>This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution.</p>\n<p>“A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.”</p>\n<p>NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad.</p>\n<p>The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.</p>\n<p><em>Lead photo: Tyler Gray for NSF.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.nasaspaceflight.com/pages/artemis-ii\"><img

Rheinmetall has not commented publicly. The reports come as Germany and other European nations intensify scrutiny of foreign takeovers involving sensitive defense technologies.</p>\n\n<p>Rocket Lab, the Long Beach, Calif.-based launch services provider and satellite manufacturer, said in March it planned to acquire Mynaric for roughly $150 million, subject to approval by German authorities under foreign direct investment rules. Nearly a year later, regulators have yet to sign off, and the deal has drawn heightened political attention as Europe accelerates efforts to build domestic space and defense capacity.</p>\n\n<p>The backdrop is Germany’s sharp increase in defense spending following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing uncertainty about long-term U.S. security commitments. Across Europe, governments are pairing higher defense budgets with industrial policies aimed at strengthening “sovereign” technological capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Laser communications terminals fall squarely into that category. Mynaric develops optical terminals that transmit data between satellites using laser links, a technology viewed as essential for next-generation defense and commercial constellations. Compared with traditional radio-frequency systems, laser links can move data at higher rates and with greater resistance to interference, making them attractive for military networks.</p>\n<aside>\t\t\t<div\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"newspack-popup-container newspack-popup hidden  newspack-inline-popup      \"\n\t\t\t\trole=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\ttabindex=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"background-color:#a61c20;color:#fff\"\n\t\t\t\tid=\"id_556152\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-segments=\"13521\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-frequency=\"0,0,1,day\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-borders is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Subscribe Today</strong><br>Get unlimited access to SpaceNews.com and our digital magazine with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-newspack-blocks-checkout-button wp-block-button  \"><form data-checkout=\"{&quot;action_type&quot;:&quot;checkout_button&quot;,&quot;currency&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;,&quot;product_id&quot;:&quot;519854&quot;,&quot;product_type&quot;:&quot;membership&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;german-defense-firm-said-to-be-weighing-bid-for-mynaric&quot;,&quot;is_variable&quot;:true,&quot;variation_ids&quot;:[558699,519864,519865,519863]}\"><button class=\"wp-block-newspack-blocks-button wp-block-button__link     \" style=\"\" type=\"submit\">Checkout Now</button> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"newspack_checkout\" value=\"1\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"after_success_button_label\" value=\"Continue\" />\t\t\t<input\n\t\t\t\tname=\"newspack_popup_id\"\n\t\t\t\ttype=\"hidden\"\n\t\t\t\tvalue=\"556152\"\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t<input\n\t\t\t\tname=\"prompt_title\"\n\t\t\t\ttype=\"hidden\"\n\t\t\t\tvalue=\"Subscribe to SpaceNews &#8211; First Article\"\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t</form></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p><strong>Discounted Access</strong> <br>Learn more about savings available for academic, government and military readers on SpaceNews subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://spacenews.com/subscribe/#subscriptions-discounts\">Save on SpaceNews</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</aside>\n\n<p>Mynaric’s CONDOR Mk3 optical terminal is designed for inter-satellite links and is already flying on spacecraft procured by the U.S. Space Development Agency for the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a planned constellation of low Earth orbit defense satellites intended to provide resilient communications and missile-tracking capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>For Rocket Lab, acquiring Mynaric would secure access to a critical subsystem and expand its footprint in Europe. The company has been building out its satellite manufacturing business alongside its launch operations and has positioned itself as an end-to-end provider of space services. Control over laser communications technology would reduce reliance on external suppliers for satellites destined for U.S. government and allied customers.</p>\n\n<p>Mynaric, for its part, has faced financial strains in recent years as it scaled production and worked through manufacturing setbacks. Despite those challenges, its technology has become strategically significant as Western governments push to deploy proliferated constellations in low Earth orbit.</p>\n\n<div id='jp-relatedposts' class='jp-relatedposts' >\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\"><span>Tagged: </span><a href=\"https://spacenews.com/tag/europe/\" rel=\"tag\">Europe</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spacenews.com/tag/germany/\" rel=\"tag\">Germany</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spacenews.com/tag/laser-communications/\" rel=\"tag\">laser communications</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spacenews.com/tag/mynaric/\" rel=\"tag\">Mynaric</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spacenews.com/tag/rocket-lab/\" rel=\"tag\">Rocket Lab</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spacenews.com/tag/sn/\" rel=\"tag\">SN</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"author-bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://spacenews.com/author/sandra-erwin/\" rel=\"author\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img data-perfmatters-preload width=\"80\" height=\"80\" src=\"https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sandra-Erwin-150x150.jpg\" class=\"avatar avatar-80 photo wp-post-image\" alt srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sandra-Erwin.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sandra-Erwin.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sandra-Erwin.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sandra-Erwin.jpg?resize=200%2C200&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sandra-Erwin-150x150.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w\" fetchpriority=\"high\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"author-bio-text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"author-bio-header\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"accent-header\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://spacenews.com/author/sandra-erwin/\" rel=\"author\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSandra Erwin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"author-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .author-meta -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .author-bio-header -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSandra Erwin writes about military space programs, policy, technology and the industry that supports this sector.

NASA had not reported any issues with helium flow or tank pressurization during a second wet dress rehearsal that concluded late Feb. 19.</p>\n\n<p>NASA initially said it had not yet made a final decision to roll the vehicle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, or VAB, and was studying options to fix the problem at the pad as well as inside the VAB. However, in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/NASAAdmin/status/2025231621436186837\">post</a>, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman called a rollback “likely.”</p>\n<aside>\t\t\t<div\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"newspack-popup-container newspack-popup hidden  newspack-inline-popup      \"\n\t\t\t\trole=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\ttabindex=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"background-color:#a61c20;color:#fff\"\n\t\t\t\tid=\"id_556152\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-segments=\"13521\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-frequency=\"0,0,1,day\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-borders is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Subscribe Today</strong><br>Get unlimited access to SpaceNews.com and our digital magazine with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-newspack-blocks-checkout-button wp-block-button  \"><form data-checkout=\"{&quot;action_type&quot;:&quot;checkout_button&quot;,&quot;currency&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;,&quot;product_id&quot;:&quot;519854&quot;,&quot;product_type&quot;:&quot;membership&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;nasa-preparing-for-artemis-2-rollback-to-fix-upper-stage-problem&quot;,&quot;is_variable&quot;:true,&quot;variation_ids&quot;:[558699,519864,519865,519863]}\"><button class=\"wp-block-newspack-blocks-button wp-block-button__link     \" style=\"\" type=\"submit\">Checkout Now</button> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"newspack_checkout\" value=\"1\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"after_success_button_label\" value=\"Continue\" />\t\t\t<input\n\t\t\t\tname=\"newspack_popup_id\"\n\t\t\t\ttype=\"hidden\"\n\t\t\t\tvalue=\"556152\"\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t<input\n\t\t\t\tname=\"prompt_title\"\n\t\t\t\ttype=\"hidden\"\n\t\t\t\tvalue=\"Subscribe to SpaceNews &#8211; First Article\"\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t</form></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p><strong>Discounted Access</strong> <br>Learn more about savings available for academic, government and military readers on SpaceNews subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://spacenews.com/subscribe/#subscriptions-discounts\">Save on SpaceNews</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</aside>\n\n<p>In a subsequent <a href=\"https://x.com/NASAAdmin/status/2025249086908125630\">post</a>, Isaacman said that while several potential causes for the problem, also seen during Artemis 1, were being considered, NASA would proceed with a rollback. &#8220;Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,&#8221; he stated.</p>\n\n<p>While studying repair options, workers began preparing for a potential rollback. That includes disassembling temporary work platforms that had just been installed at the launch pad for tasks such as retesting the rocket’s flight termination system. That work could not wait until Feb. 22, the agency said, because of high winds forecast that day.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement came a day after agency officials said at a briefing that <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/nasa-targeting-march-6-for-artemis-2-launch/\">they were working toward launching Artemis 2 as soon as March 6</a>, the first day of the next launch period for the mission. That opportunity runs through March 11.</p>\n\n<p>The upper stage problem and possible rollback “will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,” NASA said.</p>\n\n<p>Isaacman stated that the rollback &#8220;will take the March launch window out of consideration.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>At the Feb. 20 briefing, NASA cautioned that work remained to prepare Artemis 2 for a March launch, including pad activities and a multiday flight readiness review.</p>\n\n<p>“But assuming that happens, it puts us in a very good position to target March 6,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for exploration systems development.</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” added John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis 2 mission management team. “It’s out there at the pad. It’s going to be there at the pad until we go fly.”</p>\n\n<p>If NASA is unable to launch Artemis 2 in March, the next launch window runs from April 1 to 6. Another window opens April 30, although NASA has not disclosed additional launch opportunities beyond the end of April.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,&#8221; Isaacman said, but noted there were &#8220;many setbacks&#8221; during the Apollo program before landing people on the moon in 1969.</p>\n\n<div id='jp-relatedposts' class='jp-relatedposts' >\n\t<h3

WASHINGTON — Just 24 hours after setting a March 6 launch date for the Artemis 2 mission, NASA announced Feb. 21 that a problem with the Space Launch System upper stage will delay the launch. In a brief statement , NASA said it was preparing to roll the SLS back from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center to the Vehicle Assembly Building after engineers found that helium flow in the rocket’s upper stage had been interrupted. Helium is used to pressurize tanks in the stage, formally known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. NASA had not reported any issues with helium flow or tank pressurization during a second wet dress rehearsal that concluded late Feb. 19. NASA initially said it had not yet made a final decision to roll the vehicle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, or VAB, and was studying options to fix the problem at the pad as well as inside the VAB. However, in a social media post , NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman called a rollback “likely.” Subscribe Today Get unlimited access to SpaceNews.com and our digital magazine with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription. Checkout Now Discounted Access Learn more about savings available for academic, government and military readers on SpaceNews subscriptions. Save on SpaceNews In a subsequent post , Isaacman said that while several potential causes for the problem, also seen during Artemis 1, were being considered, NASA would proceed with a rollback. \"Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,\" he stated. While studying repair options, workers began preparing for a potential rollback. That includes disassembling temporary work platforms that had just been installed at the launch pad for tasks such as retesting the rocket’s flight termination system. That work could not wait until Feb. 22, the agency said, because of high winds forecast that day. The announcement came a day after agency officials said at a briefing that they were working toward launching Artemis 2 as soon as March 6 , the first day of the next launch period for the mission. That opportunity runs through March 11. The upper stage problem and possible rollback “will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,” NASA said. Isaacman stated that the rollback \"will take the March launch window out of consideration.\" At the Feb. 20 briefing, NASA cautioned that work remained to prepare Artemis 2 for a March launch, including pad activities and a multiday flight readiness review. “But assuming that happens, it puts us in a very good position to target March 6,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for exploration systems development. “I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” added John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis 2 mission management team. “It’s out there at the pad. It’s going to be there at the pad until we go fly.” If NASA is unable to launch Artemis 2 in March, the next launch window runs from April 1 to 6. Another window opens April 30, although NASA has not disclosed additional launch opportunities beyond the end of April. \"I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,\" Isaacman said, but noted there were \"many setbacks\" during the Apollo program before landing people on the moon in 1969.",

The work will push the already delayed mission from March to at least early April, officials said Saturday.</p>\n<p>Pressurized helium is used to push propellants to rocket engines for ignition and to purge various fuel lines to clear them out before propellants flow. It’s not yet known what might be preventing helium to flow back into the SLS rocket’s upper stage following a successful countdown rehearsal test that ended Thursday.</p>\n<p>“Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building),” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a post on the social media platform X. “We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">As an update to my earlier post.</p>\n<p>&#8211; The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization.

The current launch period ends on March 11. The available launch dates next month are April 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6.</p>\n<p>Wiseman, Glover, Koch and Hansen originally hoped to launch early this month, but hydrogen leaks detected during an initial “wet dress countdown” rehearsal ultimately pushed the flight to March.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72631\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72631\" style=\"width: 678px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72631\" src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260219_Artemis-II_WDR-2_clock.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"678\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260219_Artemis-II_WDR-2_clock.jpeg 678w, https://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260219_Artemis-II_WDR-2_clock-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-72631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The countdown clock at the Kennedy Space Center Press Site stops at T-29 seconds at the end of the second terminal countdown demonstration, bringing an end to the wet dress rehearsal tanking test on Thursday, Feb. 19, 2026.

Managers said Friday the team would press ahead for a launch attempt on March 6 to send Wiseman and his crewmates to the moon.</p>\n<p>Hoping for the best, the astronauts went into pre-flight medical quarantine at the Johnson Space Center Friday evening and planned to fly to the Kennedy Space Center on March 1 to prepare for launch. They now will leave quarantine to await developments.</p>\n<p>“I understand people are disappointed by this development,” Isaacman said. “That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor. During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks.</p>\n<p>“There are many differences between the 1960s and today, and expectations should rightfully be high after the time and expense invested in this program.</p>\n<p>“I will say again, the President created Artemis as a program that will far surpass what America achieved during Apollo. We will return in the years ahead, we will build a Moon base, and undertake what should be continuous missions to and from the lunar environment. Where we begin with this architecture and flight rate is not where it will end.”</p>\n\t</div><div class=\"entry-tags clearfix\"><i class=\"fa fa-tag\"></i><ul><li><a

SpaceX’s most flown Falcon 9 rocket booster launched once again Saturday night, making its 33rd mission to space and back as the company works to certify its boosters for up to 40 flights each. The Starlink 6-104 mission added another 28 broadband internet satellites to SpaceX’s growing low Earth orbit constellation of more than 9,700 satellites. Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station happened at 10:47 p.m. EST (0347 UTC). The Falcon 9 rocket flew on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving the pad. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a greater than 95 percent chance for favorable weather during liftoff, citing no specific meteorological concerns. The 33rd flight of Falcon 9 booster 1067 came about 2.5 months after its previous launch in early December. Its previous missions include four flights for NASA, the European Commission’s Galileo L13, and 20 batches of Starlink satellites. Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1067 landed on the droneship, ‘A Shortfall of Gravitas,’ positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. This was the 143rd landing on this vessel and the 575th booster landing to date for SpaceX.",

The work will push the already delayed mission from March to at least early April, officials said Saturday. Pressurized helium is used to push propellants to rocket engines for ignition and to purge various fuel lines to clear them out before propellants flow. It’s not yet known what might be preventing helium to flow back into the SLS rocket’s upper stage following a successful countdown rehearsal test that ended Thursday. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building),” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a post on the social media platform X. “We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration.” As an update to my earlier post. – The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization.

Because of the ever-changing positions of the Earth and moon, and associated changes in lighting and other factors, only a handful of launch opportunities are available each month that meet the Artemis 2 mission requirements. The current launch period ends on March 11. The available launch dates next month are April 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Wiseman, Glover, Koch and Hansen originally hoped to launch early this month, but hydrogen leaks detected during an initial “wet dress countdown” rehearsal ultimately pushed the flight to March. NASA completed a second fueling test and countdown Thursday, loading the Space Launch System rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel while working through the steps that will be needed to actually launch the huge rocket on the long-awaited mission. The test went well, there were no fuel leaks like the ones that derailed plans for a launch earlier this month. Managers said Friday the team would press ahead for a launch attempt on March 6 to send Wiseman and his crewmates to the moon. Hoping for the best, the astronauts went into pre-flight medical quarantine at the Johnson Space Center Friday evening and planned to fly to the Kennedy Space Center on March 1 to prepare for launch. They now will leave quarantine to await developments. “I understand people are disappointed by this development,” Isaacman said. “That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor. During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks. “There are many differences between the 1960s and today, and expectations should rightfully be high after the time and expense invested in this program. “I will say again, the President created Artemis as a program that will far surpass what America achieved during Apollo. We will return in the years ahead, we will build a Moon base, and undertake what should be continuous missions to and from the lunar environment. Where we begin with this architecture and flight rate is not where it will end.”",

                          "content": "NASA is gearing up for a likely rollback of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The decision follows an unexpected interruption in helium flow within the rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS), observed overnight on Saturday, February 21, 2026. This issue with the ICPS has prompted teams to review data and prepare contingency measures, effectively ruling out the targeted March launch window and pushing the mission toward a possible April liftoff if the rollback is confirmed. Pre-rollback work is already underway, including the removal of pad access platforms installed yesterday. These platforms are subject to wind constraints and cannot be removed during high winds, which are forecasted for tomorrow. Following a successful second Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), NASA took the unusual step of announcing a target launch date of March 6 for Artemis II—despite traditionally waiting until the completion of the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) to set firm dates. Less than 24 hours later, that date became non-viable after an overnight helium flow anomaly was noted. Discover more NASA merchandise Chinese spaceflight analysis Space exploration books NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman addressed the development in a statement, emphasizing the troubleshooting efforts underway. “After overnight data showed an interruption in helium flow in the SLS interim cryogenic propulsion stage, teams are troubleshooting and preparing for a likely rollback of Artemis II to the VAB,” Isaacman said. “This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window.” Notably, NSF was hearing rumors of a potential vehicle issue that could result in a rollback on Saturday morning. Less than an hour later, NASA and Isaacman published a statement online—an impressive sign of the Administrator’s commitment to increasing transparency at the agency. The ICPS, or Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, is effectively the SLS rocket’s upper stage. Derived from the Delta IV rocket’s second stage and adapted for Artemis missions, it uses liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) as propellants to provide the necessary thrust after core stage burnout, enabling the Orion spacecraft to reach lunar orbit insertion trajectories. Helium plays a vital role in this system. Stored in onboard bottles, it purges the engines of residual gases and pressurizes the LH2 and LOX tanks during ascent. According to Isaacman, the ICPS helium system performed flawlessly during the first two Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs), which are full-scale fueling simulations conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues. “The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2,” he noted. The problem emerged during a routine repressurization operation last evening, catching teams off guard. “This was an unexpected development during routine helium flow operations last evening. The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added. Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022. Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket. Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments. Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed. See Also Artemis Section L2 Artemis Click here to Join L2 The vehicle remains in a safe configuration, relying on ground-based environmental control systems (ECS) for engine purging instead of the onboard helium supply. This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution. “A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.” NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad. The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.

These platforms are subject to wind constraints and cannot be removed during high winds, which are forecasted for tomorrow.</p>\n<div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"display: flex;

Stored in onboard bottles, it purges the engines of residual gases and pressurizes the LH2 and LOX tanks during ascent.</p>\n<p>According to Isaacman, the ICPS helium system performed flawlessly during the first two Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs), which are full-scale fueling simulations conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues.</p>\n<p>“The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2,” he noted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem emerged during a routine repressurization operation last evening, catching teams off guard.</p>\n<p>“This was an unexpected development during routine helium flow operations last evening. The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added.</p>\n<p>Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022.</p>\n<p>Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket.</p>\n<p>Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments.</p>\n<p>Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack.<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-112152\" src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1560\" height=\"885\" srcset=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916.jpg 1560w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-350x199.jpg 350w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-617x350.jpg 617w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-1170x664.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1560px) 100vw, 1560px\">“Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed.</p>\n<aside class=\"penci-sidebar-content widget l2-info\"><h4 class=\"widget-title penci-border-arrow\"><span class=\"inner-arrow\">See Also</span></h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=48.0\">Artemis Section</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=37.0\">L2 Artemis</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/\">Click here to Join L2</a></li></ul></aside>\n<p>The vehicle remains in a safe configuration, relying on ground-based environmental control systems (ECS) for engine purging instead of the onboard helium supply.</p>\n<p>This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution.</p>\n<p>“A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.”</p>\n<p>NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad.</p>\n<p>The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.</p>\n<p><em>Lead photo: Tyler Gray for NSF.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.nasaspaceflight.com/pages/artemis-ii\"><img

                          "content": "WASHINGTON — Rheinmetall, Germany’s largest defense contractor, is weighing a potential acquisition of Munich-based laser communications terminal maker Mynaric, a move that could upend Rocket Lab’s previously announced plan to buy the company. German media first reported Rheinmetall’s interest, citing a desire to keep critical aerospace and laser communications technology under German and European control. Rheinmetall has not commented publicly. The reports come as Germany and other European nations intensify scrutiny of foreign takeovers involving sensitive defense technologies. Rocket Lab, the Long Beach, Calif.-based launch services provider and satellite manufacturer, said in March it planned to acquire Mynaric for roughly $150 million, subject to approval by German authorities under foreign direct investment rules. Nearly a year later, regulators have yet to sign off, and the deal has drawn heightened political attention as Europe accelerates efforts to build domestic space and defense capacity. The backdrop is Germany’s sharp increase in defense spending following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing uncertainty about long-term U.S. security commitments. Across Europe, governments are pairing higher defense budgets with industrial policies aimed at strengthening “sovereign” technological capabilities. Laser communications terminals fall squarely into that category. Mynaric develops optical terminals that transmit data between satellites using laser links, a technology viewed as essential for next-generation defense and commercial constellations. Compared with traditional radio-frequency systems, laser links can move data at higher rates and with greater resistance to interference, making them attractive for military networks.

Save on SpaceNews Mynaric’s CONDOR Mk3 optical terminal is designed for inter-satellite links and is already flying on spacecraft procured by the U.S. Space Development Agency for the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a planned constellation of low Earth orbit defense satellites intended to provide resilient communications and missile-tracking capabilities. For Rocket Lab, acquiring Mynaric would secure access to a critical subsystem and expand its footprint in Europe. The company has been building out its satellite manufacturing business alongside its launch operations and has positioned itself as an end-to-end provider of space services. Control over laser communications technology would reduce reliance on external suppliers for satellites destined for U.S. government and allied customers. Mynaric, for its part, has faced financial strains in recent years as it scaled production and worked through manufacturing setbacks. Despite those challenges, its technology has become strategically significant as Western governments push to deploy proliferated constellations in low Earth orbit.",

Nearly a year later, regulators have yet to sign off, and the deal has drawn heightened political attention as Europe accelerates efforts to build domestic space and defense capacity.</p>\n\n<p>The backdrop is Germany’s sharp increase in defense spending following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing uncertainty about long-term U.S. security commitments. Across Europe, governments are pairing higher defense budgets with industrial policies aimed at strengthening “sovereign” technological capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Laser communications terminals fall squarely into that category. Mynaric develops optical terminals that transmit data between satellites using laser links, a technology viewed as essential for next-generation defense and commercial constellations. Compared with traditional radio-frequency systems, laser links can move data at higher rates and with greater resistance to interference, making them attractive for military networks.</p>\n<aside>\t\t\t<div\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"newspack-popup-container newspack-popup hidden  newspack-inline-popup      \"\n\t\t\t\trole=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\ttabindex=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\tstyle=\"background-color:#a61c20;color:#fff\"\n\t\t\t\tid=\"id_556152\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-segments=\"13521\"\n\t\t\t\tdata-frequency=\"0,0,1,day\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-borders is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Subscribe Today</strong><br>Get unlimited access to SpaceNews.com and our digital magazine with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-newspack-blocks-checkout-button wp-block-button  \"><form data-checkout=\"{&quot;action_type&quot;:&quot;checkout_button&quot;,&quot;currency&quot;:&quot;USD&quot;,&quot;product_id&quot;:&quot;519854&quot;,&quot;product_type&quot;:&quot;membership&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;german-defense-firm-said-to-be-weighing-bid-for-mynaric&quot;,&quot;is_variable&quot;:true,&quot;variation_ids&quot;:[558699,519864,519865,519863]}\"><button class=\"wp-block-newspack-blocks-button wp-block-button__link     \" style=\"\" type=\"submit\">Checkout Now</button> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"newspack_checkout\" value=\"1\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"after_success_button_label\" value=\"Continue\" />\t\t\t<input\n\t\t\t\tname=\"newspack_popup_id\"\n\t\t\t\ttype=\"hidden\"\n\t\t\t\tvalue=\"556152\"\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t<input\n\t\t\t\tname=\"prompt_title\"\n\t\t\t\ttype=\"hidden\"\n\t\t\t\tvalue=\"Subscribe to SpaceNews &#8211; First Article\"\n\t\t\t/>\n\t\t</form></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p><strong>Discounted Access</strong> <br>Learn more about savings available for academic, government and military readers on SpaceNews subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://spacenews.com/subscribe/#subscriptions-discounts\">Save on SpaceNews</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</aside>\n\n<p>Mynaric’s CONDOR Mk3 optical terminal is designed for inter-satellite links and is already flying on spacecraft procured by the U.S. Space Development Agency for the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a planned constellation of low Earth orbit defense satellites intended to provide resilient communications and missile-tracking capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>For Rocket Lab, acquiring Mynaric would secure access to a critical subsystem and expand its footprint in Europe.

WASHINGTON — Just 24 hours after setting a March 6 launch date for the Artemis 2 mission, NASA announced Feb. 21 that a problem with the Space Launch System upper stage will delay the launch. In a brief statement , NASA said it was preparing to roll the SLS back from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center to the Vehicle Assembly Building after engineers found that helium flow in the rocket’s upper stage had been interrupted. Helium is used to pressurize tanks in the stage, formally known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. NASA had not reported any issues with helium flow or tank pressurization during a second wet dress rehearsal that concluded late Feb. 19. NASA initially said it had not yet made a final decision to roll the vehicle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, or VAB, and was studying options to fix the problem at the pad as well as inside the VAB. However, in a social media post , NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman called a rollback “likely.” Subscribe Today Get unlimited access to SpaceNews.com and our digital magazine with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription.

Save on SpaceNews In a subsequent post , Isaacman said that while several potential causes for the problem, also seen during Artemis 1, were being considered, NASA would proceed with a rollback. \"Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,\" he stated. While studying repair options, workers began preparing for a potential rollback. That includes disassembling temporary work platforms that had just been installed at the launch pad for tasks such as retesting the rocket’s flight termination system. That work could not wait until Feb. 22, the agency said, because of high winds forecast that day. The announcement came a day after agency officials said at a briefing that they were working toward launching Artemis 2 as soon as March 6 , the first day of the next launch period for the mission. That opportunity runs through March 11. The upper stage problem and possible rollback “will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,” NASA said. Isaacman stated that the rollback \"will take the March launch window out of consideration.\" At the Feb. 20 briefing, NASA cautioned that work remained to prepare Artemis 2 for a March launch, including pad activities and a multiday flight readiness review. “But assuming that happens, it puts us in a very good position to target March 6,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for exploration systems development. “I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” added John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis 2 mission management team. “It’s out there at the pad. It’s going to be there at the pad until we go fly.” If NASA is unable to launch Artemis 2 in March, the next launch window runs from April 1 to 6. Another window opens April 30, although NASA has not disclosed additional launch opportunities beyond the end of April. \"I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,\" Isaacman said, but noted there were \"many setbacks\" during the Apollo program before landing people on the moon in 1969.",

SpaceX’s most flown Falcon 9 rocket booster launched once again Saturday night, making its 33rd mission to space and back as the company works to certify its boosters for up to 40 flights each. The Starlink 6-104 mission added another 28 broadband internet satellites to SpaceX’s growing low Earth orbit constellation of more than 9,700 satellites. Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station happened at 10:47 p.m. EST (0347 UTC). The Falcon 9 rocket flew on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving the pad. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a greater than 95 percent chance for favorable weather during liftoff, citing no specific meteorological concerns. The 33rd flight of Falcon 9 booster 1067 came about 2.5 months after its previous launch in early December. Its previous missions include four flights for NASA, the European Commission’s Galileo L13, and 20 batches of Starlink satellites. Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1067 landed on the droneship, ‘A Shortfall of Gravitas,’ positioned in the Atlantic Ocean.

The work will push the already delayed mission from March to at least early April, officials said Saturday. Pressurized helium is used to push propellants to rocket engines for ignition and to purge various fuel lines to clear them out before propellants flow. It’s not yet known what might be preventing helium to flow back into the SLS rocket’s upper stage following a successful countdown rehearsal test that ended Thursday. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building),” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a post on the social media platform X. “We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration.” As an update to my earlier post. – The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization.

This… https://t.co/Qte3nEXwQb — NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman (@NASAAdmin) February 21, 2026 The Artemis 2 mission aims to send four astronauts – Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen – on a flight around the far side of the moon and back to thoroughly test the agency’s Orion deep space capsule to help clear the way for a lunar landing mission, Artemis 3, in 2028. Because of the ever-changing positions of the Earth and moon, and associated changes in lighting and other factors, only a handful of launch opportunities are available each month that meet the Artemis 2 mission requirements. The current launch period ends on March 11. The available launch dates next month are April 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Wiseman, Glover, Koch and Hansen originally hoped to launch early this month, but hydrogen leaks detected during an initial “wet dress countdown” rehearsal ultimately pushed the flight to March. NASA completed a second fueling test and countdown Thursday, loading the Space Launch System rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel while working through the steps that will be needed to actually launch the huge rocket on the long-awaited mission. The test went well, there were no fuel leaks like the ones that derailed plans for a launch earlier this month. Managers said Friday the team would press ahead for a launch attempt on March 6 to send Wiseman and his crewmates to the moon. Hoping for the best, the astronauts went into pre-flight medical quarantine at the Johnson Space Center Friday evening and planned to fly to the Kennedy Space Center on March 1 to prepare for launch. They now will leave quarantine to await developments. “I understand people are disappointed by this development,” Isaacman said. “That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor. During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks. “There are many differences between the 1960s and today, and expectations should rightfully be high after the time and expense invested in this program. “I will say again, the President created Artemis as a program that will far surpass what America achieved during Apollo. We will return in the years ahead, we will build a Moon base, and undertake what should be continuous missions to and from the lunar environment. Where we begin with this architecture and flight rate is not where it will end.”",

The decision follows an unexpected interruption in helium flow within the rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS), observed overnight on Saturday, February 21, 2026. This issue with the ICPS has prompted teams to review data and prepare contingency measures, effectively ruling out the targeted March launch window and pushing the mission toward a possible April liftoff if the rollback is confirmed. Pre-rollback work is already underway, including the removal of pad access platforms installed yesterday. These platforms are subject to wind constraints and cannot be removed during high winds, which are forecasted for tomorrow. Following a successful second Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), NASA took the unusual step of announcing a target launch date of March 6 for Artemis II—despite traditionally waiting until the completion of the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) to set firm dates. Less than 24 hours later, that date became non-viable after an overnight helium flow anomaly was noted. Discover more NASA merchandise Chinese spaceflight analysis Space exploration books NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman addressed the development in a statement, emphasizing the troubleshooting efforts underway. “After overnight data showed an interruption in helium flow in the SLS interim cryogenic propulsion stage, teams are troubleshooting and preparing for a likely rollback of Artemis II to the VAB,” Isaacman said. “This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window.” Notably, NSF was hearing rumors of a potential vehicle issue that could result in a rollback on Saturday morning. Less than an hour later, NASA and Isaacman published a statement online—an impressive sign of the Administrator’s commitment to increasing transparency at the agency. The ICPS, or Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, is effectively the SLS rocket’s upper stage. Derived from the Delta IV rocket’s second stage and adapted for Artemis missions, it uses liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) as propellants to provide the necessary thrust after core stage burnout, enabling the Orion spacecraft to reach lunar orbit insertion trajectories. Helium plays a vital role in this system. Stored in onboard bottles, it purges the engines of residual gases and pressurizes the LH2 and LOX tanks during ascent. According to Isaacman, the ICPS helium system performed flawlessly during the first two Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs), which are full-scale fueling simulations conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues. “The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2,” he noted. The problem emerged during a routine repressurization operation last evening, catching teams off guard. “This was an unexpected development during routine helium flow operations last evening. The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added. Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022. Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket. Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments. Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed.

This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution. “A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.” NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad. The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.

Stored in onboard bottles, it purges the engines of residual gases and pressurizes the LH2 and LOX tanks during ascent.</p>\n<p>According to Isaacman, the ICPS helium system performed flawlessly during the first two Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs), which are full-scale fueling simulations conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues.</p>\n<p>“The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2,” he noted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem emerged during a routine repressurization operation last evening, catching teams off guard.</p>\n<p>“This was an unexpected development during routine helium flow operations last evening. The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added.</p>\n<p>Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022.</p>\n<p>Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket.</p>\n<p>Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments.</p>\n<p>Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack.<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-112152\" src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1560\" height=\"885\" srcset=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916.jpg 1560w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-350x199.jpg 350w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-617x350.jpg 617w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-37-44-916-1170x664.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1560px) 100vw, 1560px\">“Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed.</p>\n<aside class=\"penci-sidebar-content widget l2-info\"><h4 class=\"widget-title penci-border-arrow\"><span class=\"inner-arrow\">See Also</span></h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=48.0\">Artemis Section</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?board=37.0\">L2 Artemis</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/\">Click here to Join L2</a></li></ul></aside>\n<p>The vehicle remains in a safe configuration, relying on ground-based environmental control systems (ECS) for engine purging instead of the onboard helium supply.</p>\n<p>This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution.</p>\n<p>“A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.”</p>\n<p>NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad.</p>\n<p>The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.</p>\n<p><em>Lead photo: Tyler Gray for NSF.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.nasaspaceflight.com/pages/artemis-ii\"><img

WASHINGTON — Just 24 hours after setting a March 6 launch date for the Artemis 2 mission, NASA announced Feb. 21 that a problem with the Space Launch System upper stage will delay the launch. In a brief statement , NASA said it was preparing to roll the SLS back from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center to the Vehicle Assembly Building after engineers found that helium flow in the rocket’s upper stage had been interrupted. Helium is used to pressurize tanks in the stage, formally known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. NASA had not reported any issues with helium flow or tank pressurization during a second wet dress rehearsal that concluded late Feb. 19. NASA initially said it had not yet made a final decision to roll the vehicle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, or VAB, and was studying options to fix the problem at the pad as well as inside the VAB. However, in a social media post , NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman called a rollback “likely.” Subscribe Today Get unlimited access to SpaceNews.com and our digital magazine with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription. Checkout Now Discounted Access Learn more about savings available for academic, government and military readers on SpaceNews subscriptions. Save on SpaceNews In a subsequent post , Isaacman said that while several potential causes for the problem, also seen during Artemis 1, were being considered, NASA would proceed with a rollback. \"Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,\" he stated. While studying repair options, workers began preparing for a potential rollback. That includes disassembling temporary work platforms that had just been installed at the launch pad for tasks such as retesting the rocket’s flight termination system. That work could not wait until Feb. 22, the agency said, because of high winds forecast that day. The announcement came a day after agency officials said at a briefing that they were working toward launching Artemis 2 as soon as March 6 , the first day of the next launch period for the mission. That opportunity runs through March 11. The upper stage problem and possible rollback “will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,” NASA said. Isaacman stated that the rollback \"will take the March launch window out of consideration.\" At the Feb. 20 briefing, NASA cautioned that work remained to prepare Artemis 2 for a March launch, including pad activities and a multiday flight readiness review. “But assuming that happens, it puts us in a very good position to target March 6,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for exploration systems development. “I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” added John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis 2 mission management team. “It’s out there at the pad. It’s going to be there at the pad until we go fly.” If NASA is unable to launch Artemis 2 in March, the next launch window runs from April 1 to 6. Another window opens April 30, although NASA has not disclosed additional launch opportunities beyond the end of April. \"I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,\" Isaacman said, but noted there were \"many setbacks\" during the Apollo program before landing people on the moon in 1969.",

SpaceX’s most flown Falcon 9 rocket booster launched once again Saturday night, making its 33rd mission to space and back as the company works to certify its boosters for up to 40 flights each. The Starlink 6-104 mission added another 28 broadband internet satellites to SpaceX’s growing low Earth orbit constellation of more than 9,700 satellites. Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station happened at 10:47 p.m. EST (0347 UTC). The Falcon 9 rocket flew on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving the pad. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a greater than 95 percent chance for favorable weather during liftoff, citing no specific meteorological concerns. The 33rd flight of Falcon 9 booster 1067 came about 2.5 months after its previous launch in early December. Its previous missions include four flights for NASA, the European Commission’s Galileo L13, and 20 batches of Starlink satellites. Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1067 landed on the droneship, ‘A Shortfall of Gravitas,’ positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. This was the 143rd landing on this vessel and the 575th booster landing to date for SpaceX.",

The work will push the already delayed mission from March to at least early April, officials said Saturday. Pressurized helium is used to push propellants to rocket engines for ignition and to purge various fuel lines to clear them out before propellants flow. It’s not yet known what might be preventing helium to flow back into the SLS rocket’s upper stage following a successful countdown rehearsal test that ended Thursday. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building),” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a post on the social media platform X. “We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration.” As an update to my earlier post. – The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization.

This… https://t.co/Qte3nEXwQb — NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman (@NASAAdmin) February 21, 2026 The Artemis 2 mission aims to send four astronauts – Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen – on a flight around the far side of the moon and back to thoroughly test the agency’s Orion deep space capsule to help clear the way for a lunar landing mission, Artemis 3, in 2028. Because of the ever-changing positions of the Earth and moon, and associated changes in lighting and other factors, only a handful of launch opportunities are available each month that meet the Artemis 2 mission requirements. The current launch period ends on March 11. The available launch dates next month are April 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Wiseman, Glover, Koch and Hansen originally hoped to launch early this month, but hydrogen leaks detected during an initial “wet dress countdown” rehearsal ultimately pushed the flight to March. NASA completed a second fueling test and countdown Thursday, loading the Space Launch System rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel while working through the steps that will be needed to actually launch the huge rocket on the long-awaited mission. The test went well, there were no fuel leaks like the ones that derailed plans for a launch earlier this month. Managers said Friday the team would press ahead for a launch attempt on March 6 to send Wiseman and his crewmates to the moon. Hoping for the best, the astronauts went into pre-flight medical quarantine at the Johnson Space Center Friday evening and planned to fly to the Kennedy Space Center on March 1 to prepare for launch. They now will leave quarantine to await developments. “I understand people are disappointed by this development,” Isaacman said. “That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor. During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks. “There are many differences between the 1960s and today, and expectations should rightfully be high after the time and expense invested in this program. “I will say again, the President created Artemis as a program that will far surpass what America achieved during Apollo. We will return in the years ahead, we will build a Moon base, and undertake what should be continuous missions to and from the lunar environment. Where we begin with this architecture and flight rate is not where it will end.”",

[NASA prepares for likely rollback of SLS, delaying Artemis II to April](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2026/02/nasa-rollback-sls-delaying-artemis-april/)\n\n**Source:** NASASpaceFlight.com | **Date:** February 21, 2026 | **Length:** 1,056 words\n\n![Featured Image](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NSF-2026-02-21-20-33-45-477-wmarked.jpg)\n\nNASA is gearing up for a likely rollback of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The decision follows an unexpected interruption in helium flow within the rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS), observed overnight on Saturday, February 21, 2026. This issue with the ICPS has prompted teams to review data and prepare contingency measures, effectively ruling out the targeted March launch window and pushing the mission toward a possible April liftoff if the rollback is confirmed. Pre-rollback work is already underway, including the removal of pad access platforms installed yesterday. These platforms are subject to wind constraints and cannot be removed during high winds, which are forecasted for tomorrow. Following a successful second Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), NASA took the unusual step of announcing a target launch date of March 6 for Artemis II—despite traditionally waiting until the completion of the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) to set firm dates. Less than 24 hours later, that date became non-viable after an overnight helium flow anomaly was noted. Discover more NASA merchandise Chinese spaceflight analysis Space exploration books NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman addressed the development in a statement, emphasizing the troubleshooting efforts underway. “After overnight data showed an interruption in helium flow in the SLS interim cryogenic propulsion stage, teams are troubleshooting and preparing for a likely rollback of Artemis II to the VAB,” Isaacman said. “This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window.” Notably, NSF was hearing rumors of a potential vehicle issue that could result in a rollback on Saturday morning. Less than an hour later, NASA and Isaacman published a statement online—an impressive sign of the Administrator’s commitment to increasing transparency at the agency. The ICPS, or Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, is effectively the SLS rocket’s upper stage. Derived from the Delta IV rocket’s second stage and adapted for Artemis missions, it uses liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) as propellants to provide the necessary thrust after core stage burnout, enabling the Orion spacecraft to reach lunar orbit insertion trajectories. Helium plays a vital role in this system. Stored in onboard bottles, it purges the engines of residual gases and pressurizes the LH2 and LOX tanks during ascent. According to Isaacman, the ICPS helium system performed flawlessly during the first two Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs), which are full-scale fueling simulations conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues. “The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2,” he noted. The problem emerged during a routine repressurization operation last evening, catching teams off guard. “This was an unexpected development during routine helium flow operations last evening. The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added. Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022. Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket. Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments. Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed. See Also Artemis Section L2 Artemis Click here to Join L2 The vehicle remains in a safe configuration, relying on ground-based environmental control systems (ECS) for engine purging instead of the onboard helium supply. This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution. “A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.” NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad. The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.

[German defense firm said to be weighing bid for Mynaric](https://spacenews.com/german-defense-firm-said-to-be-weighing-bid-for-mynaric/)\n\n**Source:** SpaceNews | **Date:** February 22, 2026 | **Length:** 426 words\n\n![Featured Image](https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FocqgZhaUAECh_z-scaled.jpeg)\n\nWASHINGTON — Rheinmetall, Germany’s largest defense contractor, is weighing a potential acquisition of Munich-based laser communications terminal maker Mynaric, a move that could upend Rocket Lab’s previously announced plan to buy the company. German media first reported Rheinmetall’s interest, citing a desire to keep critical aerospace and laser communications technology under German and European control. Rheinmetall has not commented publicly. The reports come as Germany and other European nations intensify scrutiny of foreign takeovers involving sensitive defense technologies. Rocket Lab, the Long Beach, Calif.-based launch services provider and satellite manufacturer, said in March it planned to acquire Mynaric for roughly $150 million, subject to approval by German authorities under foreign direct investment rules. Nearly a year later, regulators have yet to sign off, and the deal has drawn heightened political attention as Europe accelerates efforts to build domestic space and defense capacity. The backdrop is Germany’s sharp increase in defense spending following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing uncertainty about long-term U.S. security commitments. Across Europe, governments are pairing higher defense budgets with industrial policies aimed at strengthening “sovereign” technological capabilities. Laser communications terminals fall squarely into that category. Mynaric develops optical terminals that transmit data between satellites using laser links, a technology viewed as essential for next-generation defense and commercial constellations. Compared with traditional radio-frequency systems, laser links can move data at higher rates and with greater resistance to interference, making them attractive for military networks.

Save on SpaceNews Mynaric’s CONDOR Mk3 optical terminal is designed for inter-satellite links and is already flying on spacecraft procured by the U.S. Space Development Agency for the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a planned constellation of low Earth orbit defense satellites intended to provide resilient communications and missile-tracking capabilities. For Rocket Lab, acquiring Mynaric would secure access to a critical subsystem and expand its footprint in Europe. The company has been building out its satellite manufacturing business alongside its launch operations and has positioned itself as an end-to-end provider of space services. Control over laser communications technology would reduce reliance on external suppliers for satellites destined for U.S. government and allied customers. Mynaric, for its part, has faced financial strains in recent years as it scaled production and worked through manufacturing setbacks. Despite those challenges, its technology has become strategically significant as Western governments push to deploy proliferated constellations in low Earth orbit.\n\n---\n\n## 3. [NASA preparing for Artemis 2 rollback to fix upper stage problem](https://spacenews.com/nasa-preparing-for-artemis-2-rollback-to-fix-upper-stage-problem/)\n\n**Source:** SpaceNews | **Date:** February 21, 2026 | **Length:** 584 words\n\n![Featured Image](https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/art2-20260202.jpeg)\n\nUpdated 12:15 p.m. Eastern with additional comments from Isaacman. WASHINGTON — Just 24 hours after setting a March 6 launch date for the Artemis 2 mission, NASA announced Feb. 21 that a problem with the Space Launch System upper stage will delay the launch. In a brief statement , NASA said it was preparing to roll the SLS back from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center to the Vehicle Assembly Building after engineers found that helium flow in the rocket’s upper stage had been interrupted. Helium is used to pressurize tanks in the stage, formally known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. NASA had not reported any issues with helium flow or tank pressurization during a second wet dress rehearsal that concluded late Feb. 19. NASA initially said it had not yet made a final decision to roll the vehicle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, or VAB, and was studying options to fix the problem at the pad as well as inside the VAB. However, in a social media post , NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman called a rollback “likely.” Subscribe Today Get unlimited access to SpaceNews.com and our digital magazine with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription. Checkout Now Discounted Access Learn more about savings available for academic, government and military readers on SpaceNews subscriptions. Save on SpaceNews In a subsequent post , Isaacman said that while several potential causes for the problem, also seen during Artemis 1, were being considered, NASA would proceed with a rollback. \"Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,\" he stated. While studying repair options, workers began preparing for a potential rollback. That includes disassembling temporary work platforms that had just been installed at the launch pad for tasks such as retesting the rocket’s flight termination system. That work could not wait until Feb. 22, the agency said, because of high winds forecast that day. The announcement came a day after agency officials said at a briefing that they were working toward launching Artemis 2 as soon as March 6 , the first day of the next launch period for the mission. That opportunity runs through March 11. The upper stage problem and possible rollback “will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,” NASA said. Isaacman stated that the rollback \"will take the March launch window out of consideration.\" At the Feb. 20 briefing, NASA cautioned that work remained to prepare Artemis 2 for a March launch, including pad activities and a multiday flight readiness review. “But assuming that happens, it puts us in a very good position to target March 6,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for exploration systems development. “I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” added John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis 2 mission management team. “It’s out there at the pad. It’s going to be there at the pad until we go fly.” If NASA is unable to launch Artemis 2 in March, the next launch window runs from April 1 to 6. Another window opens April 30, although NASA has not disclosed additional launch opportunities beyond the end of April. \"I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,\" Isaacman said, but noted there were \"many setbacks\" during the Apollo program before landing people on the moon in 1969.\n\n---\n\n## 4. [SpaceX’s most-flown Falcon booster launches on record 33rd flight](https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/21/live-coverage-spacexs-most-flown-falcon-booster-to-launch-on-record-33rd-flight/)\n\n**Source:** Spaceflight Now | **Date:** February 21, 2026 | **Length:** 196 words\n\n![Featured Image](http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260221_Starlink_6-104_MC-1.jpeg)\n\nUpdate Feb. 21, 12 a.m. EST (0500 UTC): SpaceX confirms satellite deployment. SpaceX’s most flown Falcon 9 rocket booster launched once again Saturday night, making its 33rd mission to space and back as the company works to certify its boosters for up to 40 flights each. The Starlink 6-104 mission added another 28 broadband internet satellites to SpaceX’s growing low Earth orbit constellation of more than 9,700 satellites. Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station happened at 10:47 p.m. EST (0347 UTC). The Falcon 9 rocket flew on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving the pad. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a greater than 95 percent chance for favorable weather during liftoff, citing no specific meteorological concerns. The 33rd flight of Falcon 9 booster 1067 came about 2.5 months after its previous launch in early December. Its previous missions include four flights for NASA, the European Commission’s Galileo L13, and 20 batches of Starlink satellites. Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1067 landed on the droneship, ‘A Shortfall of Gravitas,’ positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. This was the 143rd landing on this vessel and the 575th booster landing to date for SpaceX.\n\n### Additional Images\n\n![Image 1](http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260221_Starlink_6-104_AB-1.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n## 5.

The work will push the already delayed mission from March to at least early April, officials said Saturday. Pressurized helium is used to push propellants to rocket engines for ignition and to purge various fuel lines to clear them out before propellants flow. It’s not yet known what might be preventing helium to flow back into the SLS rocket’s upper stage following a successful countdown rehearsal test that ended Thursday. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building),” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a post on the social media platform X. “We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration.” As an update to my earlier post. – The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2. – Last evening, the team was unable to get helium flow through the vehicle. This… https://t.co/Qte3nEXwQb — NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman (@NASAAdmin) February 21, 2026 The Artemis 2 mission aims to send four astronauts – Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen – on a flight around the far side of the moon and back to thoroughly test the agency’s Orion deep space capsule to help clear the way for a lunar landing mission, Artemis 3, in 2028. Because of the ever-changing positions of the Earth and moon, and associated changes in lighting and other factors, only a handful of launch opportunities are available each month that meet the Artemis 2 mission requirements. The current launch period ends on March 11. The available launch dates next month are April 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Wiseman, Glover, Koch and Hansen originally hoped to launch early this month, but hydrogen leaks detected during an initial “wet dress countdown” rehearsal ultimately pushed the flight to March. NASA completed a second fueling test and countdown Thursday, loading the Space Launch System rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel while working through the steps that will be needed to actually launch the huge rocket on the long-awaited mission. The test went well, there were no fuel leaks like the ones that derailed plans for a launch earlier this month. Managers said Friday the team would press ahead for a launch attempt on March 6 to send Wiseman and his crewmates to the moon. Hoping for the best, the astronauts went into pre-flight medical quarantine at the Johnson Space Center Friday evening and planned to fly to the Kennedy Space Center on March 1 to prepare for launch. They now will leave quarantine to await developments. “I understand people are disappointed by this development,” Isaacman said. “That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor. During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks. “There are many differences between the 1960s and today, and expectations should rightfully be high after the time and expense invested in this program. “I will say again, the President created Artemis as a program that will far surpass what America achieved during Apollo. We will return in the years ahead, we will build a Moon base, and undertake what should be continuous missions to and from the lunar environment. Where we begin with this architecture and flight rate is not where it will end.”\n\n### Additional Images\n\n![Image 1](http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260219_Artemis-II_WDR-2_clock.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n*End Of Articles*\n",

NASA is preparing to potentially move the Artemis 2 rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building due to a helium flow issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>NASA said it noticed that the flow of helium to the Space Launch System (rocket&#8217;s) interim cryogenic propulsion stage was interrupted overnight. NASA was reviewing the data ahead of a possible roll back of the massive rocket to the Vehicle Assembly Building.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Teams are actively reviewing data, and taking steps to enable rollback positions for NASA to address the issue as soon as possible while engineers determine the best path forward. In order to protect for troubleshooting options at both Pad B and the VAB, teams are making preparations to remove the pad access platforms installed yesterday, which have wind-driven constraints and cannot be removed during high winds, which are forecasted for tomorrow.&#8221;\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>NASA said that &#8220;this will almost assuredly impact the March launch window.&#8221; \n\n</p><div style='margin:5px auto; margin-bottom: 15px;' id='zone_load_830920671'><broadstreet-zone place=\"0\" callback=\"zone_load_830920671\" zone-id=\"172237\" keywords=\"not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,launch,news,helium-disruption-threatens-artemis-2-march-launch-window,post\" soft-keywords=\"true\" zone-alias=\"\"></broadstreet-zone></div><script>window.zone_load_830920671 = function(z, d) { if (!d.count) document.getElementById('zone_load_830920671').style.display = 'none'; };</script>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>More to come.\n\n\n\n<div id='jp-relatedposts' class='jp-relatedposts' >\n\t<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\t<footer class=\"entry-footer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"tags-links\"><span>Tagged: </span><a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/tag/artemis-ii/\" rel=\"tag\">Artemis II</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/tag/artemis-program/\" rel=\"tag\">Artemis Program</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/tag/canadian-space-agency/\" rel=\"tag\">Canadian Space Agency</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/tag/jeremy-hansen/\" rel=\"tag\">Jeremy Hansen</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/tag/moon/\" rel=\"tag\">Moon</a><span class=\"sep\">,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/tag/nasa/\" rel=\"tag\">NASA</a></span>\t</footer><!-- .entry-footer -->\n\n\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"author-bio\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"author-bio-text\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"author-bio-header\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"accent-header\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/author/marcboucher/\" rel=\"author\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarc Boucher<span class=\"author-job-title\">Founder, Editor-in-Chief</span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"author-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"author-social-links\"><li class=\"linkedin\"><a href=\"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/marckboucher\" target=\"_blank\"><svg class=\"svg-icon\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M19.7,3H4.3C3.582,3,3,3.582,3,4.3v15.4C3,20.418,3.582,21,4.3,21h15.4c0.718,0,1.3-0.582,1.3-1.3V4.3 C21,3.582,20.418,3,19.7,3z M8.339,18.338H5.667v-8.59h2.672V18.338z M7.004,8.574c-0.857,0-1.549-0.694-1.549-1.548 c0-0.855,0.691-1.548,1.549-1.548c0.854,0,1.547,0.694,1.547,1.548C8.551,7.881,7.858,8.574,7.004,8.574z M18.339,18.338h-2.669 v-4.177c0-0.996-0.017-2.278-1.387-2.278c-1.389,0-1.601,1.086-1.601,2.206v4.249h-2.667v-8.59h2.559v1.174h0.037 c0.356-0.675,1.227-1.387,2.526-1.387c2.703,0,3.203,1.779,3.203,4.092V18.338z\"></path><title>linkedin</title></svg></a></li></ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .author-meta -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .author-bio-header -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Marc Boucher is an entrepreneur, writer, editor, podcaster and publisher.

As a Canadian keeping an eye on the cosmos, I’m thrilled to share some intriguing updates from the past day. Let’s dive into three stories that caught my attention, from unexpected delays to cutting-edge tech and a breathtaking cosmic view.\n\n<h3>China Delays Shenzhou-20 Crew Return Due to Suspected Debris Impact</h3>\nFirst up, a concerning development in China’s human spaceflight program. The return of the Shenzhou-20 crew has been delayed after a suspected space debris impact on their spacecraft. This mission, involving a three-person crew aboard China’s Tiangong space station, was set to conclude soon, but officials are taking precautions to ensure safety. Space debris is an ever-growing issue in orbit, with thousands of fragments posing risks to active missions. The delay highlights the need for better debris tracking and mitigation strategies. While no injuries have been reported, it’s a reminder of how unpredictable space can be. Here’s hoping the crew returns safely once the situation is resolved.\n\n<h3>Cyber Defenses in Orbit with Deloitte’s Silent Shield</h3>\nNext, let’s talk tech. Deloitte is stepping into the space cybersecurity game with their “Silent Shield” payloads, designed to test whether satellites can defend themselves against cyberattacks. With satellites playing a critical role in communications, weather monitoring, and more, protecting them from digital threats is vital. These payloads will be tested in orbit, simulating real-world cyber risks to develop stronger defenses. It’s a bit like giving satellites their own antivirus software—pretty neat, right? This initiative could shape how we secure space assets in an era where cyber warfare is a real concern.\n\n<h3>Euclid Telescope Captures a Dusty Cosmic Veil</h3>\nFinally, a visual treat from the European Space Agency’s Euclid telescope. It’s captured a stunning image of LDN 1641, a dark cloud nebula 1,300 light-years away in the Orion constellation. This shimmering view reveals interstellar gas and dust where stars are born, hidden behind a dusty veil. Euclid’s mission is to map the universe in 3D, and images like this help us understand star formation and cosmic structures. It’s a humbling glimpse into the universe’s nursery—space never fails to amaze!\n\n<h3><b>Citations</b></h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>China Delays Shenzhou-20 Crew Return After Suspected Space Debris Impact - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/china-delays-shenzhou-20-crew-return-after-suspected-space-debris-impact/\">https://spacenews.com/china-delays-shenzhou-20-crew-return-after-suspected-space-debris-impact/</a></li>\n    <li>The Race to Defend Satellites from Cyberattacks - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/deloittes-payloads-will-test-whether-satellites-can-defend-themselves/\">https://spacenews.com/deloittes-payloads-will-test-whether-satellites-can-defend-themselves/</a></li>\n    <li>Euclid Peers Through a Dark Cloud’s Dusty Veil - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/11/Euclid_peers_through_a_dark_cloud_s_dusty_veil\">https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/11/Euclid_peers_through_a_dark_cloud_s_dusty_veil</a></li>\n</ul>",

Today, I’m diving into three fascinating stories from the latest space updates that caught my eye. Let’s explore what’s happening beyond our atmosphere with a mix of wonder and a tiny pinch of humor—because, let’s face it, space is seriously cool, but it’s also a bit wild!</p>\n\n<h2>1. Managing the Orbital Traffic Jam</h2>\n<p>Imagine trying to keep track of every car on a highway during rush hour—now multiply that chaos by a thousand and put it in orbit. That’s the challenge discussed in a recent article about space domain awareness. The number of active satellites in low Earth orbit has skyrocketed from under 1,000 in 2019 to over 10,000 today, largely thanks to massive constellations like Starlink. The real hurdle isn’t collecting data on these objects; it’s managing the flood of information to prevent collisions and ensure safe navigation. With more megaconstellations on the horizon, experts are scrambling to develop better tools and coordination. It’s like being a cosmic air traffic controller—except the stakes are way higher, and there’s no coffee break in sight.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Blue Origin’s New Glenn Ready for Mars Mission</h2>\n<p>Blue Origin is making waves with its New Glenn rocket, set for its second launch on November 9. This mission will carry two NASA spacecraft destined for Mars as part of the ESCAPADE program, aimed at studying the Red Planet’s atmosphere. A successful static fire test on October 30, where all seven BE-4 engines roared to life, has cleared the way for this exciting step. It’s a big moment for Blue Origin, showing they’re not just in the game but pushing boundaries. I can’t help but wonder if Mars is ready for its close-up—or if it’ll photobomb the mission with a dust storm!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Rocket Lab’s Latest Launch for iQPS</h2>\n<p>Rocket Lab continues to impress with its Electron rocket, launching a radar imaging satellite for the Japanese company iQPS on November 5. This is the sixth satellite in their constellation, designed to provide high-resolution Earth imagery for various applications, from disaster monitoring to urban planning. Rocket Lab’s precision and reliability shine here, proving small rockets can punch above their weight. It’s inspiring to see such innovation, and honestly, it makes me wish I could order a satellite photo of my backyard—just to check if my garden’s as messy as I think.</p>\n\n<h3><b>Citations</b></h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Managing space domain awareness data has become a greater challenge than collecting it - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/managing-space-domain-awareness-data-has-become-a-greater-challenge-than-collecting-it/\">https://spacenews.com/managing-space-domain-awareness-data-has-become-a-greater-challenge-than-collecting-it/</a></li>\n    <li>Second New Glenn launch set for Nov. 9 - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/second-new-glenn-launch-set-for-nov-9/\">https://spacenews.com/second-new-glenn-launch-set-for-nov-9/</a></li>\n    <li>Rocket Lab launches sixth iQPS satellite - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-launches-sixth-iqps-satellite/\">https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-launches-sixth-iqps-satellite/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Yes, it’s really called Baguette One. No, I’m not making that up. Slated for launch in 2026, this bread-themed rocket aims to test rapid cargo delivery from space, potentially paving the way for faster orbital logistics. While it won’t be delivering actual baguettes (yet), the mission could help refine how we move critical supplies through near-space corridors.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>AST SpaceMobile</strong> is pushing forward with plans for a “sovereign” direct-to-device satellite network over Europe. What does that mean? Essentially, your phone might soon connect directly to satellites without needing special hardware—think emergency messaging or basic internet in remote areas, backed by a system registered through Germany to meet European regulatory standards. It’s not quite “Starlink in your pocket,” but it’s getting closer.</p>\n\n<p>And let’s not overlook the successful launch of <strong>Copernicus Sentinel-1D</strong> aboard an Ariane 6 rocket from French Guiana on November 4. This satellite joins its siblings in monitoring Earth’s surface—tracking everything from glacier melt to illegal fishing—with radar that works day and night, rain or shine. It’s the kind of quiet, essential infrastructure that rarely makes headlines but keeps our planet’s health data flowing.</p>\n\n<p>So while there were no explosions, delays, or Canadian-flagged launches this round (sorry, Canadarm fans), the steady drumbeat of innovation continues—one oddly named rocket at a time.</p>\n\n<b>Citations</b>\n<ul>\n    <li>ATMOS to Launch Demonstration Mission Aboard Baguette One Rocket - <a href=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/atmos-to-launch-demonstration-mission-aboard-baguette-one-rocket/\">https://europeanspaceflight.com/atmos-to-launch-demonstration-mission-aboard-baguette-one-rocket/</a></li>\n    <li>AST SpaceMobile sheds more light on sovereign direct-to-device plan for Europe - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/ast-spacemobile-sheds-more-light-on-sovereign-direct-to-device-plan-for-europe/\">https://spacenews.com/ast-spacemobile-sheds-more-light-on-sovereign-direct-to-device-plan-for-europe/</a></li>\n    <li>Copernicus Sentinel-1D journey to space - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2025/11/Copernicus_Sentinel-1D_journey_to_space\">https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2025/11/Copernicus_Sentinel-1D_journey_to_space</a></li>\n</ul>",

With this weekend’s dual missions, China has officially surpassed its previous record for orbital launch attempts in a single calendar year. The country’s rapid cadence underscores a strategic push toward mastering VLEO operations—a challenging but potentially game-changing domain for Earth observation and communications. No dramatic explosions, no delays—just two clean launches and another milestone quietly checked off.</p>\n\n<h2>Blue Origin’s Second New Glenn Launch Heads to Mars</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, down in Florida, Blue Origin is gearing up for its second flight of the massive New Glenn rocket. Scheduled for Sunday afternoon (2:45 p.m. ET), this mission will carry NASA’s ESCAPADE Mars mission—two small CubeSats designed to study the Red Planet’s magnetosphere. It’s NASA’s first Mars mission since 2020, and notably, Blue Origin is navigating FAA restrictions on commercial launches by seeking special exemptions to keep things on track. If successful, this flight could mark a turning point for New Glenn as a reliable heavy-lift vehicle—something the U.S. launch manifest has needed for years.</p>\n\n<h2>Intuitive Machines Expands with Lanteris Acquisition</h2>\n<p>In another strategic move, lunar lander company Intuitive Machines has acquired satellite maker Lanteris Space Systems. The deal isn’t just about hardware—it’s a play for broader roles in national defense and deep space exploration, including potential crewed lunar landers and participation in the U.S. Space Force’s Golden Dome missile tracking architecture. For a company that’s already delivered payloads to the Moon, this could be the step that transitions them from niche player to major aerospace integrator.</p>\n\n<h3><b>Citations</b></h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>China breaks annual launch record with VLEO Chutian and Shiyan technology test launches - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/china-breaks-annual-launch-record-with-vleo-chutian-and-shiyan-technology-test-launches/\">https://spacenews.com/china-breaks-annual-launch-record-with-vleo-chutian-and-shiyan-technology-test-launches/</a></li>\n  <li>Blue Origin Readies Second New Glenn Mission With Two Mars Cubesats Onboard - <a href=\"https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/blue-origin-readies-second-new-glenn-mission-with-two-mars-cubesats-onboard/\">https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/blue-origin-readies-second-new-glenn-mission-with-two-mars-cubesats-onboard/</a></li>\n  <li>Intuitive Machines sees Lanteris deal creating new opportunities in defense and exploration - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/intuitive-machines-sees-lanteris-deal-creating-new-opportunities-in-defense-and-exploration/\">https://spacenews.com/intuitive-machines-sees-lanteris-deal-creating-new-opportunities-in-defense-and-exploration/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Built by Airbus under contract with the European Space Agency (ESA), ESM-4 will provide critical life support—oxygen, water, power, and thermal control—for astronauts during their lunar expedition. Its completion marks another steady step forward in international collaboration for deep space exploration, even as other parts of the space sector face turbulence.\n\nMeanwhile, Blue Origin scrubbed the second launch of its New Glenn rocket, which was slated to carry NASA’s ESCAPADE Mars mission. Weather and unspecified technical concerns prompted the hold, delaying what would have been a major milestone for the company. New Glenn’s debut has been long anticipated, and while delays are common in rocketry (no one’s launching on a coffee break schedule), this one adds pressure as competitors press forward.\n\nSpeaking of pressure—NASA itself is at a crossroads. With leadership in flux, a new administrator will soon need to untangle a web of overlapping priorities: Artemis timelines, aging infrastructure, commercial partnerships, and budget constraints. As one recent analysis bluntly put it, “NASA is kind of a mess.” That’s not cynicism—it’s a call for clear-eyed leadership. Whoever takes the reins will face tough calls, from managing moon ambitions to maintaining Earth science programs.\n\nAll this might sound dramatic, but in spaceflight, even the calmest days are built on layers of complexity. One module sails quietly across an ocean; another rocket waits out the clouds; an agency braces for change. It’s not all fireworks—sometimes it’s just good old-fashioned problem-solving, with a side of cosmic ambition.\n\n<h2>Citations</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>European Service Module-4 is ready to sail - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/European_Service_Module-4_is_ready_to_sail\">https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/European_Service_Module-4_is_ready_to_sail</a></li>\n  <li>Blue Origin scrubs New Glenn launch of ESCAPADE - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-scrubs-new-glenn-launch-of-escapade/\">https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-scrubs-new-glenn-launch-of-escapade/</a></li>\n  <li>NASA is kind of a mess: Here are the top priorities for a new administrator - <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/nasa-is-kind-of-a-mess-here-are-the-top-priorities-for-a-new-administrator/\">https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/11/nasa-is-kind-of-a-mess-here-are-the-top-priorities-for-a-new-administrator/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Rocket Lab has officially pushed the debut of its next-gen **Neutron rocket** to 2026. The New Zealand–founded, U.S.-based company says it’s opting for patience over haste, aiming to ensure the first flight is a success rather than a spectacle. Given the Neutron’s role as a partially reusable medium-lift vehicle meant to compete in the growing satellite mega-constellation market, getting it right matters. CEO Peter Beck emphasized that launching too soon could undermine confidence; better to wait and deliver reliably. For those tracking launch manifests, this delay reshuffles timelines—but it’s a pragmatic move in an industry where second chances are expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, the **Shenzhou-20 mission** remains in a holding pattern. Chinese officials are still assessing damage from a suspected piece of orbital debris that may have struck the spacecraft. While crews aboard China’s space station appear safe, the return timeline is now uncertain. Space debris continues to be a silent, high-velocity threat—reminding us that even the most advanced missions remain vulnerable to the clutter we’ve left in low Earth orbit.\n\nOn a brighter note, **John McFall**, a Paralympic sprinter, orthopedic surgeon, and ESA Astronaut Reserve member, is proving that space is becoming more inclusive. His recent work with ESA’s **FLY initiative** confirms there are “no technical showstoppers” preventing astronauts with prosthetics from flying to the ISS. From parabolic flights to hardware certifications, McFall’s involvement isn’t just symbolic—it’s paving the way for a broader definition of who gets to explore space. As he puts it: if you can run on Earth with a prosthesis, why not in microgravity?\n\n<h2>Citations</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Rocket Lab delays first Neutron launch to 2026 - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-delays-first-neutron-launch-to-2026/\">https://spacenews.com/rocket-lab-delays-first-neutron-launch-to-2026/</a></li>\n  <li>China continues assessment of Shenzhou-20 crew return after suspected debris strike - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/china-continues-assessment-of-shenzhou-20-crew-return-after-suspected-debris-strike/\">https://spacenews.com/china-continues-assessment-of-shenzhou-20-crew-return-after-suspected-debris-strike/</a></li>\n  <li>John McFall | Prosthetics, Possibility & Parabolic Flights | ESA Explores #16 - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2025/10/John_McFall_Prosthetics_Possibility_Parabolic_Flights_ESA_Explores_16\">https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2025/10/John_McFall_Prosthetics_Possibility_Parabolic_Flights_ESA_Explores_16</a></li>\n</ul>",

A recent investigation into the failure of **MethaneSAT**, a privately operated satellite designed to monitor global methane emissions, came up empty-handed. Despite exhaustive analysis, engineers couldn’t pinpoint a single root cause for the spacecraft’s loss earlier this year. The satellite, backed by the Environmental Defense Fund and Harvard University, was meant to provide high-resolution data to help combat climate change. That it failed is a setback; that we don’t know why is a reminder of how complex space systems remain—even in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, on the brighter side of aerospace news, **Germany’s OHB Digital Connect** has landed a €10.7 million contract to supply 86 ultra-sensitive receivers for the **Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory**—the future home of the world’s largest radio telescope. Based in Bremen, OHB will contribute to the SKA-Mid array in South Africa, helping astronomers peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before. It’s a quiet but pivotal step in an international effort that could revolutionize our understanding of dark energy, cosmic magnetism, and the early universe.\n\nAnd speaking of long views: the **European Space Agency (ESA)** just marked 30 years of satellite navigation in Europe. From early prototypes to the full deployment of **Galileo and EGNOS**, Europe’s independent GPS alternatives now support everything from emergency response to precision farming. A recent celebration at ESA’s ESTEC facility in the Netherlands highlighted decades of collaboration—and served as a gentle reminder that sometimes, the most critical space infrastructure is the kind we barely notice… until it’s not there. (Though I did once get lost in rural Saskatchewan because my phone briefly forgot where it was.

Recent airspace closure notices issued over Inner Mongolia—a standard precaution before crewed landings—strongly suggest a touchdown may occur within the next few days. The original return timeline was disrupted after mission controllers observed signs consistent with a micrometeoroid or orbital debris strike on the spacecraft while docked to the Tiangong space station.</p>\n<p>Though neither the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) nor state media have confirmed damage, the delay and subsequent airspace activity point to a cautious, safety-first approach—an increasingly common posture as low Earth orbit gets more crowded. The Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched in April 2025, has been conducting scientific experiments and technology demonstrations aboard Tiangong. Its three taikonauts have remained in good health throughout the extended stay.</p>\n<p>This incident underscores a growing operational reality: even with advanced tracking systems, the risk from untrackable small debris remains. Fortunately, modern crewed spacecraft like Shenzhou are built with multiple layers of shielding, and mission rules allow for flexible return schedules. If all proceeds as expected, this landing will mark another successful chapter in China’s steadily expanding human spaceflight program—one that, like all others, must constantly navigate the invisible hazards of orbit.</p>\n\n<h3>First Confirmed “Star Burp” Spotted by ESA and LOFAR</h3>\n<img src=\"https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2025/11/an_explosion_on_another_star_artist_s_impression/26962601-1-eng-GB/An_explosion_on_another_star_artist_s_impression_card_full.jpg\" alt=\"Artist's impression of an explosive burst on a nearby star\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<p>Astronomers have recorded the first definitive observation of an explosive burst of plasma erupting from a star other than our Sun—a discovery that could reshape how we understand stellar weather and its effects on orbiting planets. Using data from the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton X-ray observatory and the LOFAR radio telescope, scientists detected a massive outburst from a red dwarf star just 130 light-years away.</p>\n<p>Unlike solar flares or coronal mass ejections from our Sun, this event was exceptionally energetic—so much so that researchers note it could strip the atmosphere from a nearby Earth-like planet in a matter of hours. Red dwarfs are known for their volatility, but until now, such violent eruptions had only been theorized. The simultaneous detection in both X-ray and radio wavelengths provided the “smoking gun” evidence needed to confirm the nature of the burst.</p>\n<p>For planetary scientists, this finding is a sobering reminder that habitability isn’t just about distance from a star. Even planets in the “Goldilocks zone” could be rendered uninhabitable by stellar tantrums. On the bright side (literally), this observation opens a new window into stellar physics. Understanding these events better may one day help future missions assess the true viability of exoplanets—and perhaps even protect spacecraft from similar outbursts during deep-space travel.</p>\n\n<h3>European Firms Gear Up for Commercial Microgravity Mission in 2026</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/atmos-phoenix2.jpeg?fit=1024%2C576&ssl=1\" alt=\"Artist's rendering of the Atmos Phoenix-2 spacecraft in orbit\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<p>Two European companies are teaming up to launch a dedicated commercial microgravity research mission next year, signaling growing confidence in the business case for in-space manufacturing and science. The mission, slated for 2026, will use a free-flying spacecraft to host experiments in materials science, fluid dynamics, and pharmaceutical development—all fields that benefit from the near-weightless environment of orbit.</p>\n<p>The collaboration brings together Atmos Space Cargo, known for its reusable orbital vehicles, and another European aerospace firm specializing in microgravity payload integration. Their spacecraft, likely based on the Phoenix platform, will offer controlled, pressurized lab conditions for weeks at a time before returning experiments safely to Earth. Unlike research conducted aboard the International Space Station, which faces scheduling and access constraints, this mission promises a more flexible and dedicated platform for private-sector clients.</p>\n<p>While Canada isn’t directly involved in this particular venture, the trend aligns with our own growing interest in space-based R&amp;D—think of projects like the Canadian Space Agency’s support for life science experiments or MDA’s work on robotic systems for orbital platforms. As the cost of access to space continues to fall, expect more “space as a lab” services to emerge. And who knows? Maybe one day a Toronto biotech startup will be perfecting protein crystals on a European microgravity bus—proving that in space commerce, it’s not just about where you launch, but what you make once you’re up there.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Airspace closure suggests China is preparing for a Shenzhou landing after debris impact scare\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/airspace-closure-suggests-china-is-preparing-for-a-shenzhou-landing-after-debris-impact-scare/\">https://spacenews.com/airspace-closure-suggests-china-is-preparing-for-a-shenzhou-landing-after-debris-impact-scare/</a></li>\n    <li>\"First confirmed sighting of explosive burst on nearby star\" - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/XMM-Newton/First_confirmed_sighting_of_explosive_burst_on_nearby_star\">https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/XMM-Newton/First_confirmed_sighting_of_explosive_burst_on_nearby_star</a></li>\n    <li>\"European companies to fly commercial microgravity mission in 2026\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/european-companies-to-fly-commercial-microgravity-mission-in-2026/\">https://spacenews.com/european-companies-to-fly-commercial-microgravity-mission-in-2026/</a></li>\n</ul>",

U.S. startup Lux Aeterna has emerged from stealth mode with a bang (or rather, a controlled reentry) by securing two new partnerships with U.S. government agencies. The company’s innovation? A heat shield technology designed to allow satellites to survive atmospheric reentry and be refurbished for future missions. If successful, this could dramatically cut costs and reduce space debris—two persistent headaches in the satellite industry.</p>\n<p>Most small satellites today are treated as disposable. Once their mission ends, they either linger uselessly in orbit or burn up on reentry. Lux Aeterna’s approach flips that script by enabling full satellite recovery. While details remain limited—understandable for a company just out of stealth—the implications are significant. Reusable satellites could make Earth observation, communications, and scientific missions more sustainable and affordable over time. For Canadian satellite operators like Telesat or smaller startups eyeing the growing smallsat market, such developments could reshape procurement strategies in the coming decade.</p>\n<p>Of course, turning the concept into routine practice is easier said than done. Surviving the extreme temperatures and forces of reentry requires materials and engineering solutions that are both lightweight and incredibly robust. But with U.S. government backing already in place, Lux Aeterna might just be the tip of a new wave in orbital asset management—one where “disposable” is no longer the default.</p>\n\n<h3>Space Junk’s Atmospheric Aftermath</h3>\n<p>While reusable satellites sound promising, another study released this week serves as a sobering reminder: every object we send to space eventually comes back—sometimes in ways we didn’t anticipate. New research, posted to the ArXiv preprint server, links the increasing number of reentering spacecraft and rocket stages to elevated levels of harmful metals in Earth’s upper atmosphere. With mega-constellations like Starlink and OneWeb growing by the hundreds (and soon thousands) of satellites, this “uncontrolled experiment” could have long-term environmental consequences.</p>\n<p>The study found that materials like aluminum—common in satellite construction—vaporize during reentry and deposit metallic particles in the mesosphere and stratosphere. These particles may interfere with atmospheric chemistry, including ozone layer dynamics and cloud formation. Scientists caution that while the immediate risk is unclear, the scale of future reentries is unprecedented. By some estimates, the total mass of spacecraft reentering annually could increase tenfold by 2030.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just an American or European issue—it’s a global one. Canadian researchers at institutions like the University of Saskatchewan and the Canadian Space Agency have long contributed to atmospheric monitoring, and this research underscores the need for international standards on spacecraft design and disposal. After all, what goes up must come down… preferably not as toxic dust.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rsz_pia24163.jpg?fit=879%2C659&ssl=1\" alt=\"Deep Space Network antenna\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>The Invisible Backbone of Lunar Missions</h3>\n<p>As the world races back to the Moon—with NASA’s Artemis program, China’s lunar ambitions, and commercial landers like those from Intuitive Machines—much of the spotlight falls on gleaming rockets and high-tech landers. But a quieter, equally critical component is Earth itself: the global network of ground stations that provide communications, tracking, and data relay for every deep space mission.</p>\n<p>This terrestrial infrastructure, often referred to as the Deep Space Network (DSN) or its international equivalents, is the unsung hero of space exploration. Without it, lunar missions would be deaf, blind, and lost. A recent SpaceNews piece highlights how this network is being expanded and modernized to meet the demands of a multi-mission lunar era. Canada, while not operating its own deep space antennas, contributes significantly through the Canadian Space Agency’s partnerships and its involvement in tracking and data systems via agreements with NASA and ESA.</p>\n<p>For instance, the CSA’s support for the Artemis program includes data relay coordination and potential use of Canadian-built instruments that rely on this Earth-based network. Moreover, Canadian universities and research centers often participate in signal processing and telemetry analysis. As more nations and companies target the Moon, the need for robust, globally distributed ground infrastructure grows. It’s a reminder that even as we reach for the stars, we remain tethered—by necessity and by design—to the planet we call home.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Lux Aeterna nets US government partnerships for reusable satellite technology\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/lux-aeterna-nets-us-government-partnerships-for-reusable-satellite-technology/\">https://spacenews.com/lux-aeterna-nets-us-government-partnerships-for-reusable-satellite-technology/</a></li>\n    <li>\"‘Uncontrolled experiment:’ Study links harmful atmospheric metals to spacecraft reentry\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/uncontrolled-experiment-study-links-harmful-atmospheric-metals-to-spacecraft-reentry/\">https://spacenews.com/uncontrolled-experiment-study-links-harmful-atmospheric-metals-to-spacecraft-reentry/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Ground truth: Why the lunar program needs its Earthbound network\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/ground-truth-why-the-lunar-program-needs-its-earthbound-network/\">https://spacenews.com/ground-truth-why-the-lunar-program-needs-its-earthbound-network/</a></li>\n</ul>",

The 21-month agreement, announced on November 14, builds on a prototype the company provided to ESA in 2024 for testing and evaluation.</p>\n<p>SBQuantum’s device uses nitrogen-vacancy centers in synthetic diamond—a quantum sensing technique that allows for extremely precise measurements of magnetic fields. These sensors could one day monitor subtle changes in Earth’s magnetosphere, track geological activity, or even support climate research by detecting ocean currents through their magnetic signatures. For a company headquartered in New Brunswick, this contract marks a major step onto the international stage.</p>\n<p>What makes this particularly noteworthy is that SBQuantum is entering a niche dominated by far larger aerospace firms, yet it’s doing so with homegrown Canadian innovation. The magnetometer’s compact size and low power requirements also make it well-suited for small satellite constellations—a growing segment where Canada has longstanding expertise, thanks in part to the legacy of the RADARSAT program. While quantum tech in space is still in its early days, contracts like this suggest Canada isn’t just keeping pace—it’s helping set the pace.</p>\n\n<h3>ESA Tracks Interstellar Comet with Mars Orbiter</h3>\n<p>Astronomers have significantly sharpened their view of 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, thanks to an ingenious use of existing assets. The European Space Agency (ESA) recently used its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO)—a spacecraft circling Mars since 2016—not to study the Red Planet’s atmosphere as originally intended, but to observe the distant comet’s trajectory from a unique vantage point 225 million kilometers away.</p>\n<p>Discovered on July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS sparked global interest as only the third confirmed object from beyond our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Pinpointing its path is critical not only for scientific understanding but also for planetary defense preparedness. ESA’s latest data, gathered by TGO’s CaSSIS camera, has improved trajectory predictions by a factor of ten—turning fuzzy forecasts into precise orbital calculations.</p>\n<p>This clever repurposing of an existing mission highlights how space agencies are maximizing scientific return without launching new hardware. While Canada doesn’t operate deep-space observatories like TGO, Canadian researchers are active participants in international comet and planetary defense collaborations. It’s a reminder that space science is rarely a solo endeavor; it’s a global relay race where data from one nation’s orbiter can refine another’s models—and everyone benefits from a clearer picture of what’s hurtling through our cosmic neighborhood.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2025/10/exomars_trace_gas_orbiter_observes_comet_3i_atlas_gif/26909471-1-eng-GB/ExoMars_Trace_Gas_Orbiter_observes_comet_3I_ATLAS_GIF_card_full.gif\" alt=\"ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter observing comet 3I/ATLAS\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Chinese Astronauts Make Emergency Return After Debris Concerns</h3>\n<p>In a dramatic but successful contingency operation, the crew of China’s Shenzhou-20 mission returned safely to Earth on November 13 aboard the newly launched Shenzhou-21 spacecraft. The unusual crew swap was necessitated by concerns that their original vehicle had sustained damage from space debris, rendering it unsafe for re-entry.</p>\n<p>The three taikonauts—Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie—had been aboard the Tiangong space station for approximately six months as part of China’s ninth crewed mission to the orbital outpost. Normally, crews return in the same capsule that brought them up, but Chinese space officials confirmed post-landing that Shenzhou-20 showed signs of potential micrometeoroid or orbital debris impact. Rather than risk the crew, mission controllers opted for a rapid turnaround: Shenzhou-21 launched on November 12 and, after a swift rendezvous, served as their ride home the next day.</p>\n<p>The flawless execution of this contingency underscores the maturity of China’s human spaceflight program. It also highlights a growing reality of low Earth orbit: as traffic increases, so does the risk of collisions. While the exact nature of the damage remains undisclosed, the incident serves as a sobering reminder that space debris isn’t just a theoretical concern—it’s an operational hazard that can ground spacecraft and force real-time mission changes. For countries like Canada, which relies on international partners for crewed access to space, such events reinforce the importance of robust contingency planning and shared orbital safety standards.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shenzhou-20-crew-return-Shenzhou21-landing-Chen-Dong-extraction-CCTV-BACC-14nov-2025.jpg?fit=1024%2C575&ssl=1\" alt=\"Shenzhou-20 crew extracted after landing in Shenzhou-21 capsule\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Canada’s SBQuantum wins contract to supply ESA magnetometer\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/canadas-sbquantum-wins-contract-to-supply-esa-magnetometer/\">https://spacenews.com/canadas-sbquantum-wins-contract-to-supply-esa-magnetometer/</a></li>\n    <li>\"ESA pinpoints 3I/ATLAS’s path with data from Mars\" - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Planetary_Defence/ESA_pinpoints_3I_ATLAS_s_path_with_data_from_Mars\">https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Planetary_Defence/ESA_pinpoints_3I_ATLAS_s_path_with_data_from_Mars</a></li>\n    <li>\"Shenzhou-20 astronauts safely return to Earth on Shenzhou-21 spacecraft after space debris damage concerns\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/shenzhou-20-astronauts-safely-return-to-earth-on-shenzhou-21-spacecraft-after-space-debris-damage-concerns/\">https://spacenews.com/shenzhou-20-astronauts-safely-return-to-earth-on-shenzhou-21-spacecraft-after-space-debris-damage-concerns/</a></li>\n</ul>",

For Canadian observers (and anyone else with a decent backyard telescope), sharper trajectory data means better chances to glimpse this cosmic wanderer if it brightens as it approaches the inner Solar System. While 3I/ATLAS won’t be Starship making headlines in Tim Hortons anytime soon, its improved track is a reminder that our planetary neighbors can lend a hand—even from 200 million kilometers away.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"New research with GW230814 upholds Hawking black hole area law\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/New_research_with_GW230814_upholds_Hawking_black_hole_area_law_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/New_research_with_GW230814_upholds_Hawking_black_hole_area_law_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"Chang'e-6 lunar mission finds impact-created hematite and maghemite in SPA Basin samples\" - <a href=\"https://www.moondaily.com/reports/Change_6_lunar_mission_finds_impact_created_hematite_and_maghemite_in_SPA_Basin_samples_999.html\">https://www.moondaily.com/reports/Change_6_lunar_mission_finds_impact_created_hematite_and_maghemite_in_SPA_Basin_samples_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"ESA pinpoints 3I/ATLAS's path with data from Mars\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/ESA_pinpoints_3I_ATLASs_path_with_data_from_Mars_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/ESA_pinpoints_3I_ATLASs_path_with_data_from_Mars_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

This is standard practice for China’s human spaceflight program: every six months, a new Shenzhou vehicle is sent up so that astronauts always have a reliable ride home. The current crew, launched in late October, will remain aboard Tiangong through at least April 2026, and having a recently arrived return vehicle ensures they aren’t relying on a capsule that’s been exposed to the space environment for too long. While it might seem unusual to send up an empty spacecraft just to park it, this redundancy is a key part of crew safety—something no spacefaring nation takes lightly. The launch will take place from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center using a Long March 2F rocket, a vehicle with a perfect crew-rated safety record. For observers tracking global space activity, this quiet logistical maneuver underscores how routine human spaceflight has become for China—even if it still feels like science fiction to the rest of us sipping Tim Hortons back on Earth.</p>\n\n<h3>Sentinel-6B Is Now Watching Our Oceans—from Canada’s Arctic</h3>\n<p>The Copernicus Sentinel-6B satellite is officially on the job, and it owes part of its early success to a very Canadian contribution: the Inuvik Satellite Station Facility in the Northwest Territories. Just over an hour after its November 17 liftoff aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Space Force Base, the satellite phoned home—and that first signal was received via Inuvik. This ground station, operated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) but strategically located north of the Arctic Circle, provides critical high-latitude coverage for polar-orbiting Earth observation missions. Sentinel-6B’s mission is deceptively simple but profoundly important: measure global sea level with millimeter precision. It continues a climate data record that stretches back to 1992, helping scientists track how fast our oceans are rising due to melting ice and thermal expansion. About the size of a pickup truck, the satellite will also improve hurricane forecasting and support maritime navigation. For Canadians, it’s a reminder that even missions launched from California often rely on infrastructure in our own backyard—especially when that backyard happens to be perfectly positioned under the orbital paths of Earth-observing satellites.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/f9-doublestreak.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"Falcon 9 rocket streaks through the night sky during launch\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>FAA Lifts the Curfew on Commercial Launches</h3>\n<p>Good news for night owls and launch photographers alike: the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has officially ended its temporary curfew on commercial space launches. The restriction, which limited launches to daylight hours, was a side effect of the recent U.S. government shutdown that hampered air traffic management resources. With normal operations restored, companies like SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and others can now schedule missions at any hour—critical for hitting precise orbital windows or coordinating with international partners across time zones. The FAA emphasized that safety remains the top priority, but the return to 24/7 launch operations reflects growing confidence in both regulatory processes and commercial operators’ ability to manage airspace coordination. In practical terms, this means we might soon see more spectacular pre-dawn or late-night launches lighting up the skies over Florida or California. For Canadian space watchers, particularly those in southern Ontario or the Maritimes who sometimes catch a glimpse of east-coast launches, it also means more opportunities to witness a rocket’s fiery trail—if you’re willing to set that very un-Canadian alarm for 3 a.m.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"China to launch Shenzhou-22 spacecraft Nov. 25 to provide lifeboat for astronauts\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/china-to-launch-shenzhou-22-spacecraft-nov-25-to-provide-lifeboat-for-astronauts/\">https://spacenews.com/china-to-launch-shenzhou-22-spacecraft-nov-25-to-provide-lifeboat-for-astronauts/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Copernicus Sentinel-6B begins mission to advance ocean science\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Copernicus_Sentinel_6B_begins_mission_to_advance_ocean_and_climate_monitoring_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Copernicus_Sentinel_6B_begins_mission_to_advance_ocean_and_climate_monitoring_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"FAA ends commercial launch curfew\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/faa-ends-commercial-launch-curfew/\">https://spacenews.com/faa-ends-commercial-launch-curfew/</a></li>\n</ul>",

But as recent editorials in <em>SpaceNews</em> point out, this vision might be more science fiction than near-term reality. While the Moon does contain valuable materials like water ice (which can be split into hydrogen and oxygen for fuel) and rare earth elements, the infrastructure required to extract and utilize them is still years—if not decades—away.</p>\n<p>More importantly, uncoordinated exploitation could lead to serious problems: orbital congestion, surface contamination, and even geopolitical tensions. Without clear international frameworks—beyond the outdated 1967 Outer Space Treaty—there’s a risk that the Moon becomes a free-for-all. Experts like Mustafa Bilal and Stirling Forbes argue that proactive cooperation, not competition, should guide lunar development. After all, nobody wants a repeat of terrestrial resource conflicts… just 384,000 km from home.</p>\n<p>For Canada, which has contributed Canadarm3 to NASA’s Gateway lunar space station, the focus remains on sustainable exploration rather than extraction. That cautious, collaborative approach might just be the steady hand the new space age needs.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/araqys-d3.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"Artist rendering of Dcubed’s in-space solar array manufacturing system\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Solar Arrays That Build Themselves—in Space</h3>\n<p>German startup Dcubed is taking a bold step toward the future of satellite power by developing technology to manufacture solar arrays directly in orbit. Their upcoming demonstration missions aim to produce large, lightweight solar structures that would be impossible to launch fully assembled from Earth. This innovation could significantly reduce launch mass and volume constraints while enabling more powerful spacecraft for communications, Earth observation, and deep-space missions.</p>\n<p>In-space manufacturing like this isn’t just about convenience—it’s a potential game-changer for mission design. Traditional solar panels must survive the violent vibrations of launch, limiting their size and efficiency. By building them in microgravity, engineers can use more delicate, high-efficiency materials and create larger surface areas. Dcubed’s approach could also pave the way for orbital construction of other components, from antennas to trusses.</p>\n<p>While Canada isn’t directly involved in Dcubed’s efforts, the country has its own growing in-space manufacturing ecosystem. Companies like Kepler Communications and NorthStar Earth & Space are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in orbit—proving that the final frontier might soon double as a factory floor.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/iss073e0814504/iss073e0814504~large.jpg\" alt=\"International Space Station crew member conducting medical research\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Protecting Astronauts’ Eyes and Lungs—One Experiment at a Time</h3>\n<p>Life in microgravity comes with hidden health risks, and this week on the International Space Station (ISS), Expedition 73 crew members are tackling two of the biggest: vision impairment and respiratory changes. Researchers are studying how fluid shifts in the body—caused by the lack of gravity—contribute to vision problems known as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS). Meanwhile, another experiment examines how lung function adapts (or doesn’t) in space, which could impact everything from emergency response to long-duration missions.</p>\n<p>These studies aren’t just academic. As agencies plan for Artemis lunar missions and eventual Mars trips, understanding and mitigating health risks becomes critical. Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen, training for Artemis II, will likely benefit directly from this research. Canada’s long-standing role in human spaceflight—through both astronauts and life sciences—means these findings also inform domestic expertise in remote health monitoring and telemedicine.</p>\n<p>While it may not involve rocket launches or lunar landings, this quiet, meticulous work aboard the ISS is what keeps future explorers safe. After all, getting to the Moon is only half the mission—coming back healthy is the other.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Avoiding a harmful lunar ‘gold rush’\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/avoiding-a-harmful-lunar-gold-rush/\">https://spacenews.com/avoiding-a-harmful-lunar-gold-rush/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Dcubed to demonstrate in-space manufacturing of solar arrays\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/dcubed-to-demonstrate-in-space-manufacturing-of-solar-arrays/\">https://spacenews.com/dcubed-to-demonstrate-in-space-manufacturing-of-solar-arrays/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Monday’s Research Studies Ways to Protect Eyes and Lungs in Space\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/spacestation/2025/11/17/mondays-research-studies-ways-to-protect-eyes-and-lungs-in-space/\">https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/spacestation/2025/11/17/mondays-research-studies-ways-to-protect-eyes-and-lungs-in-space/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Announced by Industry Minister Mélanie Joly at the SpaceBound conference in Ottawa, the investment underscores Canada’s intent to diversify its international space partnerships amid growing economic uncertainty with its traditional ally, the United States. As the only non-European Cooperating State in ESA—a status held since 1979—Canada gains selective access to ESA’s optional programmes, opening doors for Canadian firms in areas like satellite communications, Earth observation, and quantum sensing.</p>\n<p>This move aligns with broader federal priorities emphasizing sovereignty, defence, and dual-use technologies. Notably, Quebec-based SBQuantum recently secured an ESA contract to develop quantum diamond magnetometer sensors, illustrating the tangible outcomes this funding could enable. Canadian delegations are already on the ground in Bremen, Germany, ahead of ESA’s Ministerial Council meeting on November 26–27, where program allocations will be finalized. While Canada remains committed to its role in NASA’s Artemis II mission—sending astronaut Jeremy Hansen around the Moon—the new investment signals a deliberate expansion of Canada’s space diplomacy beyond North America.</p>\n\n<h3>Isaacman faces second Senate hearing for NASA administrator role</h3>\n<p>Jared Isaacman, the billionaire entrepreneur and Polaris Program commander, is heading back to Capitol Hill for another confirmation hearing to become NASA’s next administrator. The Senate Commerce Committee has scheduled a second session for next month, following initial testimony that drew both praise for his spaceflight experience and scrutiny over his private-sector background. Isaacman, who funded and commanded the all-civilian Inspiration4 mission, was nominated by President Biden earlier this year and has since engaged with lawmakers on issues ranging from Artemis sustainability to commercial space regulation.</p>\n<p>While his nomination enjoys support from key figures like Senator Ted Cruz, concerns remain about potential conflicts of interest given his leadership at Shift4 Payments and involvement with SpaceX-led missions. The second hearing suggests the committee seeks further clarity—perhaps on NASA’s budget trajectory, climate research priorities, or how a private astronaut-turned-administrator would balance public and commercial interests. For Canada, the outcome matters: NASA remains a critical partner in ISS operations, lunar exploration, and Earth science collaborations. A confirmed administrator could accelerate joint planning for post-ISS activities and deep-space initiatives where Canadian robotics and AI expertise may play a role.</p>\n\n<h3>Kepler sets January 2026 launch for optical data relay constellation</h3>\n<p>Toronto-based Kepler Communications is gearing up for a major expansion of its in-orbit connectivity network, with ten 300-kilogram satellites slated for launch in January 2026. The mission, set to lift off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, will deploy the first operational segment of Kepler’s optical data relay constellation. Each satellite will carry at least four optical terminals capable of establishing high-throughput laser links between spacecraft, aircraft, and ground stations—effectively creating a real-time data backbone in low Earth orbit.</p>\n<p>This move positions Kepler at the forefront of a growing trend: space-based optical networking, which offers higher bandwidth and greater security than traditional radio-frequency systems. The company, founded in 2015 by Canadian engineers from the University of Toronto, has steadily matured from a CubeSat pioneer to a provider of “space internet” infrastructure. Its system could support everything from Arctic environmental monitoring to military reconnaissance and commercial Earth observation. With Canadian firms increasingly focused on dual-use satellite tech—as highlighted at this week’s SpaceBound conference—Kepler’s upcoming launch exemplifies homegrown innovation scaling to global relevance. The timing also aligns with Canada’s renewed emphasis on sovereign space capabilities and international market access.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Canada Commits $528.5 Million to European Space Agency Programmes\" - <a href=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/canada-commits-528-5-million-to-european-space-agency-programmes/\">https://europeanspaceflight.com/canada-commits-528-5-million-to-european-space-agency-programmes/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Senate Commerce Committee schedules hearing on Isaacman renomination\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/senate-commerce-committee-schedules-hearing-on-isaacman-renomination/\">https://spacenews.com/senate-commerce-committee-schedules-hearing-on-isaacman-renomination/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Kepler sets January launch for optical data relay satellites to expand in-orbit connectivity\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Kepler_sets_January_launch_for_optical_data_relay_satellites_to_expand_in_orbit_connectivity_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Kepler_sets_January_launch_for_optical_data_relay_satellites_to_expand_in_orbit_connectivity_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

With a population under 40 million and a venture ecosystem dwarfed by that of the U.S., Canada struggles to provide robust Series A or B funding rounds—something American firms like Stoke Space and EnduroSat have secured in the nine-figure range this year alone. Panelists from RBC, IQT, ONE9, and Gallant MacDonald emphasized that while Canada’s R&D tax credits and CSA programs like STDP offer support, they’re insufficient without deeper government backing. One strategic move came just hours after the panel: Canada announced a tenfold increase in its European Space Agency (ESA) contribution—now $528 million—aimed at creating more opportunities for homegrown firms. The message was clear: Canadian companies must either partner internationally, expand operations abroad, or risk relocating entirely. As one panelist bluntly put it, “Waiting for consensus won’t cut it in venture capital—you have to back winners decisively.”</p>\n\n<h3>Orbital Clouds and AI: The Next Layer of Space Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>While rockets grab headlines, a quieter revolution is unfolding in low Earth orbit (LEO): the integration of AI compute, satellite networks, and blockchain verification into a unified “orbital cloud.” PowerBank Corporation and Smartlink AI have teamed up under the Orbit AI banner to launch two complementary systems—DeStarlink, a decentralized satellite communications network, and DeStarAI, a solar-powered AI processing platform. Unlike traditional ground-based data centers, this architecture promises ultra-low latency and global coverage by performing AI inference directly in orbit. The implications are significant for applications requiring real-time decision-making, from disaster response to autonomous navigation. Though still in early development, the project reflects a broader trend: as launch costs fall and satellite lifespans increase, space is becoming less about access and more about utility. For Canadian firms specializing in communications or AI, such initiatives could offer niche opportunities—especially if they align with the growing demand for sovereign, resilient infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h3>ESA’s Argonaut Lunar Lander Gains Momentum—and Partners</h3>\n<p>Europe is stepping up its lunar ambitions with the expansion of the Argonaut lunar lander program. At a press conference held at ESA’s European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, new industrial agreements were signed among Thales Alenia Space (Italy, France, and the UK), Germany’s OHB system AG, and UK-based Nammo. These partnerships solidify the multinational effort behind Europe’s first autonomous lunar lander, designed to deliver up to 1,000 kilograms of cargo to the Moon’s surface. While Canada isn’t a direct contractor on Argonaut, its recent commitment to increase ESA contributions tenfold suggests Canadian companies may soon find pathways into lunar supply chains—particularly in robotics, communications, or power systems where Canadian expertise is well-established. The timing is strategic: with NASA’s Artemis program accelerating and global interest in cislunar space growing, ESA’s move signals that the Moon is no longer just a destination for superpowers. As one ESA official noted, “Argonaut isn’t just about landing—it’s about building a sustainable European presence beyond Earth.”</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"SpaceBound: Where to find money for a space business\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/spacebound-where-to-find-money-for-a-space-business/\">https://spaceq.ca/spacebound-where-to-find-money-for-a-space-business/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Orbital cloud project to combine solar powered AI compute and satellite network in low Earth orbit\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Orbital_cloud_project_to_combine_solar_powered_AI_compute_and_satellite_network_in_low_Earth_orbit_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Orbital_cloud_project_to_combine_solar_powered_AI_compute_and_satellite_network_in_low_Earth_orbit_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"Argonaut lunar lander family grows\" - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Argonaut_lunar_lander_family_grows\">https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Argonaut_lunar_lander_family_grows</a></li>\n</ul>",

Stewart Bain of NorthStar Earth & Space likened defence procurement to rocket launch windows—miss them, and the opportunity may not come again. Mina Mitry of Kepler Communications emphasized that companies must deeply understand the security concerns inherent in defence work, embedding risk-aware cultures from leadership down.</p>\n<p>Scott McCrady of Magellan Aerospace offered cautious optimism about the newly announced Defence Investment Agency (DIA), noting it could streamline decisions—or add another bureaucratic layer. Longtime public servant Mary Preville highlighted persistent hurdles like limited security clearance access and siloed communication. All agreed on one thing: Canada’s last space strategy dates to 2019, a lifetime ago in space terms. With space now “contested” and cislunar ambitions growing, the call for a modern industrial roadmap is urgent—and overdue.</p>\n\n<h3>CSA’s Campbell Champions “Buy Canadian” Amid New ESA Partnership</h3>\n<p>Canadian Space Agency president Lisa Campbell used her SpaceBound keynote to reinforce the federal government’s emphasis on domestic capacity and sovereign capabilities. Speaking to an audience of industry stakeholders, she highlighted that CSA procurements are exempt from many international trade agreements—a policy that has helped Canada excel in robotics, Earth observation, and communications. “Like most other countries, we protect this high-investment, high-risk sector deliberately,” she said.</p>\n<p>Her remarks come amid growing concern over potential U.S. policy shifts that could affect cross-border space trade. To diversify opportunities, Industry Minister Mélanie Joly announced $528.5 million in new funding to deepen Canadian industry ties with the European Space Agency. While details on timing and disbursement remain vague, the move signals a strategic pivot toward European partnerships. Campbell’s consistent messaging—“export more, buy Canadian”—may sound familiar, but in today’s geopolitical climate, it carries renewed weight for a sector eyeing both innovation and resilience.</p>\n\n<h3>Suborbital Success at Spaceport Nova Scotia</h3>\n<p>Canada’s spaceport ambitions took a tangible leap forward on November 20, 2025, when a T-Minus Engineering Barracuda hypersonic suborbital rocket launched from Spaceport Nova Scotia at 10:54 a.m. ET. While the rocket didn’t reach the Kármán line (100 km), Maritime Launch Services (MLS) CEO Steve Matier called it a resounding success for operational readiness. “We achieved every mission parameter we hoped for—and then some,” he told SpaceQ, noting challenges like European dockworker strikes and last-minute coordination with offshore fishermen.</p>\n<p>The launch refined safety protocols and strengthened collaboration among Transport Canada, NAV CANADA, the RCMP, and local emergency teams. Onboard was the “STORIES of Space” payload, carrying over 1,000 student-submitted stories and mission patches—an educational outreach milestone and the program’s fifth successful flight. Though the exact apogee remains unreleased, the test validated the spaceport’s infrastructure and procedures. T-Minus Engineering plans to return next year, and Matier hinted this is just the beginning for Nova Scotia as a launch hub—proving that even suborbital flights can carry big dreams.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"SpaceBound: Strategy and community needed to respond to defence needs\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/spacebound-strategy-and-community-needed-to-respond-to-defence-needs/\">https://spaceq.ca/spacebound-strategy-and-community-needed-to-respond-to-defence-needs/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Canadian Space Agency president Lisa Campbell relays government talking points\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/canadian-space-agency-president-lisa-campbell-relays-government-talking-points/\">https://spaceq.ca/canadian-space-agency-president-lisa-campbell-relays-government-talking-points/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Suborbital rocket lifts off from Spaceport Nova Scotia\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/suborbital-rocket-lifts-off-from-spaceport-nova-scotia/\">https://spaceq.ca/suborbital-rocket-lifts-off-from-spaceport-nova-scotia/</a></li>\n</ul>",

With climate change accelerating and foreign interest in the region growing, panelists from organizations like Calian Group, Viasat, Arctic360, and Terrestar Solutions stressed that robust communications, energy, and health infrastructure aren’t just conveniences—they’re strategic necessities.</p>\n<p>Michael Adamson of Calian noted that even the Canadian military, accustomed to operating in harsh conditions, lacks sufficient data centres and power systems in the North. Meanwhile, Arctic360 is mapping existing infrastructure to guide future investments. A recurring theme? Avoid siloed efforts. Whether it’s underwater monitoring or land-based logistics, integrated systems are key. The panel also flagged Telesat’s upcoming Lightspeed constellation—set for launch next year—as a homegrown solution to prevent overreliance on foreign satellite providers like Starlink or Amazon Kuiper. As one participant put it, “Good comms aren’t a luxury up there—they’re as essential as heat.”</p>\n\n<h3>Starship Setback Raises Questions About Development Pace</h3>\n<p>SpaceX’s ambitious Starship program hit a bump during testing on November 21, 2025, when the first next-generation booster suffered significant damage. The incident occurred during ground-based evaluations at Starbase in Texas and has fueled fresh skepticism about the vehicle’s already aggressive development timeline.</p>\n<p>While SpaceX has not released detailed diagnostics, the damage appears substantial enough to delay upcoming milestones. This is the latest in a string of technical hurdles for Starship, which NASA intends to use for Artemis III—the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo. Though setbacks are common in experimental aerospace programs (remember the early Falcon 1 failures?), each delay complicates coordination with partners and missions downstream. For Canadian firms eyeing opportunities in lunar logistics or deep-space services, Starship’s reliability remains a watch item—not a dealbreaker, but certainly a variable worth monitoring.</p>\n\n<h3>ESA’s Argonaut Lunar Lander Gains Industrial Momentum</h3>\n<p>Europe is stepping up its lunar ambitions with the formal expansion of its Argonaut lunar lander program. On November 21, the European Space Agency announced new industrial agreements with Thales Alenia Space (Italy, France, and UK), OHB Germany, and Nammo UK to develop this robotic cargo lander, designed to deliver payloads to the Moon’s surface.</p>\n<p>What makes this noteworthy for Canadian readers? Canadian aerospace giant MDA Space is already a key partner in Starlab—the commercial space station backed by ESA allies—and maintains strong ties with European space entities. While Argonaut itself isn’t a Canadian-led project, its development signals growing international demand for reliable lunar infrastructure, a niche where Canadian robotics expertise (think Canadarm3 for the Gateway station) could find new markets. The lander is slated to fly on Ariane 6, with test missions expected later this decade. As lunar commerce shifts from theory to practice, Canada’s role may be less about flags and more about functional hardware that keeps operations running—quietly, reliably, and very much on time.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"SpaceBound: Building out the North to meet challenges\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/spacebound-building-out-the-north-to-meet-challenges/\">https://spaceq.ca/spacebound-building-out-the-north-to-meet-challenges/</a></li>\n    <li>\"First next-generation Starship booster damaged in testing\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/first-next-generation-starship-booster-damaged-in-testing/\">https://spacenews.com/first-next-generation-starship-booster-damaged-in-testing/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Argonaut lunar landers to deliver cargo on Ariane 6 missions\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Argonaut_lunar_landers_to_deliver_cargo_on_Ariane_6_missions_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Argonaut_lunar_landers_to_deliver_cargo_on_Ariane_6_missions_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

In January 2025, ESA awarded an €862 million contract to a consortium led by Thales Alenia Space Italy, and now the partnership has expanded to include Nammo, OHB System, and two of Thales Alenia’s own subsidiaries. Argonaut—named after the mythological Greek ship that sought the Golden Fleece—is designed to deliver up to 1,150 kilograms of cargo to the Moon’s surface and support future scientific and exploration missions. Unlike one-off landers, Argonaut is being developed with reusability and sustainability in mind, potentially enabling regular trips between lunar orbit and the surface. While Canada isn’t listed among the primary industrial partners, Canadian firms with expertise in robotics, AI, and space-qualified components may yet find opportunities as the program matures. With NASA’s Artemis program aiming for annual lunar landings by the late 2020s, ESA’s lander could become a key node in a truly international lunar logistics network.</p>\n\n<h3>HTV-X1 Completes Its Mission with a Fiery Farewell</h3>\n<img src=\"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/htv-x_in_space__image_20251122191933.jpg\" alt=\"JAXA's HTV-X1 spacecraft docked to the International Space Station\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<p>Earlier today, Japan’s HTV-X1 cargo spacecraft undocked from the International Space Station and began its final descent through Earth’s atmosphere. Carrying several tons of waste and obsolete hardware from the orbital laboratory, the uncrewed vehicle executed a controlled, destructive reentry—ensuring that nothing hazardous reached the ground. Developed by JAXA as the successor to the venerable Kounotori (HTV) series, HTV-X1 introduced significant upgrades, including enhanced autonomous rendezvous capabilities and a more efficient propulsion system. Its successful mission marks a quiet but critical milestone in space logistics: keeping the ISS clean, safe, and functional. While much of the aerospace spotlight focuses on new rockets and flashy landers, these “orbital garbage trucks” are indispensable. Canada, with its long history of supporting ISS operations through Canadarm2 and Dextre, shares an interest in reliable resupply and waste disposal systems—especially as plans for future commercial space stations take shape. The HTV-X program is expected to support both the ISS and, eventually, Japan’s contributions to the Lunar Gateway.</p>\n\n<h3>SpaceX Launches Fresh Starlink Batch from Vandenberg</h3>\n<img src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251122-Vandy-File-Falcon-9-Feature-Image.jpg\" alt=\"Falcon 9 rocket launching from Vandenberg Space Force Base\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<p>At 12:34 a.m. PST (0834 UTC), SpaceX successfully launched 28 Starlink satellites aboard a brand-new Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. This mission—part of the ongoing effort to expand and refresh the Starlink megaconstellation—delivered its payload to low Earth orbit before the first stage returned for a pinpoint landing on the drone ship <em>Just Read the Instructions</em> stationed in the Pacific. Notably, this was the maiden flight for this particular booster, adding to SpaceX’s growing fleet of flight-proven rockets. From a Canadian perspective, these launches matter: Starlink already provides internet access to remote and rural communities across Canada, including Indigenous and northern regions where traditional infrastructure is impractical. With the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission recently streamlining approvals for satellite-based broadband, more Canadians may soon benefit from this expanding orbital network. And while we may not get many clear views of Falcon 9 launches from the West Coast, our nighttime skies are increasingly dotted with the silent, steady march of these reflective satellites—both a marvel and a reminder of how crowded low Earth orbit is becoming.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Thales Alenia Space Finalises Industrial Team for ESA’s Argonaut Lunar Lander\" - <a href=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/thales-alenia-space-finalises-industrial-team-for-esas-argonaut-lunar-lander/\">https://europeanspaceflight.com/thales-alenia-space-finalises-industrial-team-for-esas-argonaut-lunar-lander/</a></li>\n    <li>\"HTV-X1 Release & Reentry\" - <a href=\"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/event/352/\">https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/event/352/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Live coverage: SpaceX to launch 28 Starlink satellites from Vandenberg on brand new Falcon 9 rocket\" - <a href=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/11/23/live-coverage-spacex-to-launch-28-starlink-satellites-from-vandenberg-on-brand-new-falcon-9-rocket/\">https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/11/23/live-coverage-spacex-to-launch-28-starlink-satellites-from-vandenberg-on-brand-new-falcon-9-rocket/</a></li>\n</ul>",

On November 25, the mission specialist participated in a bilingual livestreamed Q&amp;A hosted by entrepreneur Fred Bastien and broadcast via the Canadian Space Agency’s channels. Hansen emphasized that Canada’s seat on the lunar flyby wasn’t handed out as a courtesy—it was earned over decades through contributions like the Canadarm systems that have supported U.S. space missions since the shuttle era.</p>\n<p>Hansen spoke candidly about the emotional whiplash of pre-launch life: one moment buzzing with excitement over the impending mission, the next immersed in urgent training simulations. With a background as a fighter pilot and years of astronaut experience, he described managing nerves by converting them into “a heightened sense of alertness” rather than letting anxiety take control. He also highlighted how Artemis 2 isn’t just about circling the Moon—it’s a springboard to inspire broader Canadian ambition, whether in space or other innovative fields. Evenings and weekends, he noted, offer rare quiet time for reflection amid the “big sims” that involve hundreds of people across multiple countries. As launch nears, every hour counts.</p>\n\n<h3>Joshua Kutryk’s Starliner Dream Hits a Detour</h3>\n<p>Canadian astronaut Joshua Kutryk’s path to the International Space Station has hit an unexpected snag. NASA announced on November 25 that the Starliner-1 mission—originally slated to carry Kutryk and others to the ISS—will now fly as a cargo-only mission no earlier than April 2026. This marks a significant shift in Boeing’s Commercial Crew contract: NASA has reduced the number of guaranteed crewed Starliner flights from six to four, with the remaining two as optional.</p>\n<p>The decision follows last year’s troubled Starliner Crew Flight Test, which saw astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams stranded on the ISS for eight months due to thruster malfunctions. Their spacecraft eventually returned uncrewed after 93 days docked to the station. With Starliner-1 now repurposed for cargo and system validation, Kutryk’s long-duration ISS mission is effectively in limbo. NASA plans up to three crewed Starliner missions after certification, but no new assignments have been announced. As of publication, the Canadian Space Agency had not issued a public statement, leaving many—including Kutryk himself—waiting for clarity on when he’ll finally get his window to orbit.</p>\n\n<h3>AI-Powered Satellite Imagery Gets a Canadian Boost</h3>\n<p>Victoria-based Pacific Geomatics (PacGeo) has teamed up with South Korea’s SI Analytics to bring cutting-edge AI satellite enhancement to Canada. Announced on November 25, the strategic partnership grants PacGeo exclusive Canadian rights to SuperX, a generative AI tool that doubles the resolution of satellite imagery using multi-resolution foundation models. The result? Sharper, more vibrant, and analysis-ready images for defense, government, and commercial users.</p>\n<p>SuperX isn’t just cosmetic—it enables advanced geospatial intelligence tasks like object detection, change monitoring, and area segmentation by reconstructing details from lower-resolution inputs as coarse as 0.25-meter imagery. “SuperX represents a paradigm shift in satellite analytics,” said SI Analytics CEO Taegyun Jeon, noting that the system allows machines to “understand, reconstruct, and predict what’s on Earth.” For Matt Tomlins, PacGeo’s president, the collaboration makes high-resolution data more accessible and cost-effective across sectors. With over 30 years in the geospatial field, PacGeo aims to integrate SuperX into operational workflows nationwide. For a country as vast and data-hungry as Canada—from resource management to Arctic monitoring—this partnership could significantly sharpen how we see our own backyard from space.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Jeremy Hansen shares message of collaboration during Artemis 2 Q&amp;A\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/jeremy-hansen-shares-message-of-collaboration-during-artemis-2-qa/\">https://spaceq.ca/jeremy-hansen-shares-message-of-collaboration-during-artemis-2-qa/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Joshua Kutryk's ISS flight in limbo with Starliner-1 mission change\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/joshua-kutryks-iss-flight-in-limbo-with-starliner-1-mission-change/\">https://spaceq.ca/joshua-kutryks-iss-flight-in-limbo-with-starliner-1-mission-change/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Pacific Geomatics and SI Analytics Announce Strategic Partnership to Deliver Super-Resolution Capabilities Across Canada\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/pacific-geomatics-and-si-analytics-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deliver-super-resolution-capabilities-across-canada/\">https://spaceq.ca/pacific-geomatics-and-si-analytics-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deliver-super-resolution-capabilities-across-canada/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Announced on November 27, 2025, the strategic partnership aims to enhance how users access and interpret high-resolution geospatial data, offering sharper, more detailed imagery for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning.</p>\n<p>While PacGeo has long served as a key distributor of commercial satellite imagery in Canada, this collaboration integrates SI Analytics’ advanced image-processing algorithms to push resolution beyond traditional limits. The result? Clearer insights without requiring new satellite hardware—a clever workaround in an era where launch costs still matter. For a country with vast, often remote territories—from the boreal forests of Northern Ontario to the Arctic Archipelago—improved imaging can mean faster response to wildfires, better infrastructure planning, and more accurate resource assessments. And let’s be honest: it’s reassuring to know that when a moose wanders onto a remote airstrip, someone on the ground might actually see it coming.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pacgeo.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Pacific Geomatics and SI Analytics partnership logo\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Norway and ESA Plot an Arctic Space Centre—With Canadian Implications</h3>\n<p>While Canada didn’t sign the paperwork, the new plan for an Arctic Space Centre by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Norway could resonate strongly in the Great White North. Announced on November 27, 2025, the initiative involves a letter of intent and a joint working group to assess the feasibility of building a dedicated facility in northern Norway—well within the Arctic Circle.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just about launching rockets (though Norway has dabbled in sounding rockets). The centre would focus on Earth observation, climate monitoring, and communications—areas where Arctic coverage is notoriously challenging but critically important. Canada, which shares similar high-latitude geography and environmental concerns, stands to benefit from shared data, collaborative missions, or even future partnerships. After all, the Arctic doesn’t respect borders, and melting permafrost or shifting sea ice affects everyone in the region. While Canada has its own space assets like the RADARSAT Constellation Mission, closer alignment with European Arctic efforts could amplify our scientific reach. Plus, if ESA’s new hub ends up monitoring caribou migrations, we’d love a heads-up.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Norwegian_Minister_of_Trade_and_Industry_Cecilie_Myrseth_and_ESA_Director_General_Josef_Aschbacher_sign_letter_of_intent-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"Norwegian Minister and ESA Director General signing Arctic Space Centre agreement\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>ESA’s Space Rider Set for 2028 Debut—Reusability Heads to Europe</h3>\n<p>Europe is finally getting its own reusable spacecraft, and it’s got a name: Space Rider. The European Space Agency confirmed on November 27, 2025, that the inaugural flight of this eight-metre-long vehicle is scheduled for 2028. Designed to carry scientific and technology demonstration payloads into low Earth orbit for up to two months before returning them safely to Earth, Space Rider represents a major step in Europe’s quest for autonomous, cost-effective access to space.</p>\n<p>Unlike SpaceX’s vertical landings or Blue Origin’s boosters, Space Rider will glide home under a steerable parafoil—a gentler, splashdown-free approach well-suited for delicate experiments. The program builds on the heritage of ESA’s Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV), tested back in 2015, but with a focus on operational utility rather than pure demonstration. For Canadian researchers and startups eyeing affordable orbital testbeds, Space Rider could offer a new channel—especially if Canada and ESA deepen their longstanding collaboration. While it won’t be flying from Canadian soil, its mission profile aligns well with our strengths in remote sensing, robotics, and microgravity science. And frankly, it’s about time Europe had its own reusable workhorse—preferably one that doesn’t require an umbrella landing.</p>\n<img src=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Inaugural-Space-Rider-Flight-to-Occur-in-2028.webp\" alt=\"Artist's rendering of ESA's Space Rider spacecraft\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Pacific Geomatics and SI Analytics Announce Strategic Partnership to Deliver Super-Resolution Capabilities Across Canada\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/pacific-geomatics-and-si-analytics-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deliver-super-resolution-capabilities-across-canada/\">https://spacenews.com/pacific-geomatics-and-si-analytics-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deliver-super-resolution-capabilities-across-canada/</a></li>\n    <li>\"ESA and Norway announce plans for an Arctic Space Centre\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/esa-and-norway-announce-plans-for-an-arctic-space-centre/\">https://spacenews.com/esa-and-norway-announce-plans-for-an-arctic-space-centre/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Inaugural Space Rider Flight to Occur in 2028\" - <a href=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/inaugural-space-rider-flight-to-occur-in-2028/\">https://europeanspaceflight.com/inaugural-space-rider-flight-to-occur-in-2028/</a></li>\n</ul>",

This marks Canada’s largest investment in the agency to date and underscores its unique role as the only non-European cooperating state in ESA. The pledge aligns with Prime Minister Mark Carney’s vision of Europe as a strategic partner in climate resilience, security, innovation, and economic growth.</p>\n<p>Canada’s funding will support participation in key ESA missions, particularly in satellite communications, Earth observation, space situational awareness, and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). While ESA secured a record €22.1 billion from its 23 member states—up 32% from 2022—the Human and Robotic Exploration program fell short of its request. Nevertheless, Canada’s contribution is expected to boost opportunities for Canadian industry in European markets and reinforce shared goals in space infrastructure resilience and strategic autonomy.</p>\n\n<h3>DND Launches $105 Million “Launch the North” Challenge for Sovereign Access to Orbit</h3>\n<p>In a major push toward space independence, Canada’s Department of National Defence (DND) has allocated $105 million for the “Launch the North” Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) Challenge. The initiative aims to develop a responsive, small-scale launch capability by 2028—capable of delivering at least 200 kg payloads to low Earth orbit within 96 hours of notice. This effort fulfills a long-overdue recommendation from the 1967 Chapman Report and responds to growing strategic concerns about reliance on foreign launch providers.</p>\n<p>The challenge is structured in three phases over three years, with up to three winners in Phase 1 sharing $25 million. By Phase 3, a $40 million grand prize will reward the most advanced, operationally viable prototype. Proposals must use ITAR-free components to ensure export flexibility and domestic industrial control. Eligible applicants include Canadian companies, universities, and non-profits. This program complements the federal government’s broader $182.6 million investment in sovereign launch infrastructure announced in Budget 2025, signaling a serious commitment to on-demand, homegrown space access.</p>\n\n<h3>CSA and UK Partner on Quantum Communications Satellite Demo</h3>\n<p>The Canadian Space Agency is seeking innovative concepts for a joint quantum communications demonstration with the United Kingdom, following up on a G7 commitment made in Kananaskis, Alberta, this past June. Through an Expression of Interest (EOI) due December 12, 2025, the CSA invites Canadian entities to propose in-orbit demonstrations that establish secure quantum links between ground networks in both countries.</p>\n<p>This initiative supports Canada’s National Quantum Strategy (2023) and builds on the upcoming launch of QEYSSat in 2026—Canada’s first quantum encryption satellite. The collaboration with Innovate UK aims to lay the groundwork for a global, next-generation quantum network, enhancing secure digital infrastructure. Projects should integrate potential end users from defense, finance, or critical infrastructure sectors, ensuring real-world applicability. By pioneering quantum satellite technology, Canada and the UK hope to lead in secure communications amid rising cyber threats and geopolitical uncertainty.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Canada formally makes large financial commitment at the ESA&nbsp;Council Meeting at Ministerial Level\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/canada-formally-makes-large-financial-commitment-at-the-esa-council-meeting-at-ministerial-level/\">https://spaceq.ca/canada-formally-makes-large-financial-commitment-at-the-esa-council-meeting-at-ministerial-level/</a></li>\n    <li>\"DND allocates $105 million for new &#8216;Launch the North' IDEaS Challenge\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/dnd-allocates-105-million-for-new-launch-the-north-ideas-challenge/\">https://spaceq.ca/dnd-allocates-105-million-for-new-launch-the-north-ideas-challenge/</a></li>\n    <li>\"The Canadian Space Agency is soliciting interest in a new quantum technology initiative\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/the-canadian-space-agency-is-soliciting-interest-in-a-new-quantum-technology-initiative/\">https://spaceq.ca/the-canadian-space-agency-is-soliciting-interest-in-a-new-quantum-technology-initiative/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Montreal-based GHGSat expanded its greenhouse gas monitoring constellation with two new satellites: GHGSat-C14 (Teodor) and GHGSat-C15 (Laila). Built by Spire Global on the LEMUR-2 platform, these additions bring GHGSat’s operational fleet to 16 satellites, with at least two more slated for launch in 2026. Meanwhile, Edmonton’s Wyvern sent its Dragonette-005 hyperspectral imaging payload aboard Loft Orbital’s YAM-9 satellite. This marks Wyvern’s second flight in 2025, following Dragonette-004’s March launch on Transporter-13. All three Canadian payloads were integrated through Exolaunch, the German manifesting firm that’s supported every SpaceX Transporter mission to date. SpaceQ has confirmed successful deployment of all payloads.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/yam-9-on-cart-1-wide-shot-scaled-crop.jpg?resize=780%2C438&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"YAM-9 satellite on transport cart at Loft Orbital facility\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Canada Pivots Toward Europe with $528.5M ESA Investment</h3>\n<p>In a strategic move to diversify international partnerships, Canadian Industry Minister Mélanie Joly announced a historic $528.5 million investment in the European Space Agency (ESA) during her surprise appearance at the SpaceBound conference in Ottawa on November 18. Speaking to a room of aerospace leaders, Joly emphasized that Canada’s space sector—employing 14,000 people and contributing $5 billion to GDP—is “at the core of something that will become bigger than all of us.” The funding aims to boost Canadian exports to Europe and create new contracts through ESA collaborations. Joly highlighted existing Canadian successes within ESA programs, such as Toronto’s Kepler as prime contractor for the HydRON mission and C-CORE in Atlantic Canada supplying satellite transponders. The investment reinforces Canada’s unique status as the only non-European permanent partner in ESA, a relationship dating back nearly 50 years. With a $81 billion, five-year defence budget now in place, Joly tied space capabilities directly to national security, citing threats ranging from cyberattacks to climate-driven wildfires.</p>\n\n<h3>Ottawa Cybersecurity Firm Joins ESA’s Space Defence Initiative</h3>\n<p>Dominant Information Solutions Canada (DISC), an Ottawa-based cybersecurity firm specializing in high-stakes incident response, has become the first Canadian company to join ESA’s Cybersecurity Makerspace program. Partnering with German satellite manufacturer OHB SE, DISC is developing a “principles-based threat assessment framework” applicable to everything from off-the-shelf smallsats to bespoke government platforms. The project, backed by a letter of support from the Canadian Space Agency under its ARTES agreement with ESA, will evaluate two contrasting satellites over the next year to identify common vulnerabilities in command telemetry, GPS signals, and sensor data streams. DISC’s team—largely composed of former DND, CSIS, and CSE personnel—brings experience from terrestrial telecom and national defence. Their prior work includes eClypse, a satellite-embedded intrusion detection system now at TRL 6. While DISC’s client list remains confidential (by policy), their involvement in ESA’s program signals growing recognition that space infrastructure is no longer “untouchable”—especially after incidents like the 2022 Viasat hack. As Marc Kneppers, DISC’s VP of R&D, put it: “The proof of our success may be the breaches that never happen.”</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"SpaceX Transporter-15 rideshare mission launches with 3 Canadian payloads\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/spacex-transporter-15-rideshare-mission-launches-with-3-canadian-payloads/\">https://spaceq.ca/spacex-transporter-15-rideshare-mission-launches-with-3-canadian-payloads/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Remarks and Q&amp;A by Industry Minister Mélanie Joly at the SpaceBound conference\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/remarks-and-qa-by-industry-minister-melanie-joly-at-the-spacebound-conference/\">https://spaceq.ca/remarks-and-qa-by-industry-minister-melanie-joly-at-the-spacebound-conference/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Dominant Information Solutions Canada (DISC) brings skillset to ESA's Cybersecurity Makerspace Program\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/dominant-information-solutions-canada-disc-brings-skillset-to-esas-cybersecurity-makerspace-program/\">https://spaceq.ca/dominant-information-solutions-canada-disc-brings-skillset-to-esas-cybersecurity-makerspace-program/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Planet confirmed the successful deployment of its Pelican 5 and Pelican 6 satellites—high-resolution, AI-enabled platforms designed to capture daily global imagery with improved revisit rates. Meanwhile, Spire added new nodes to its constellation focused on maritime tracking, weather prediction, and radio frequency intelligence.</p>\n<p>Rideshare missions like Transporter-15 have become the workhorse of the smallsat industry, offering cost-effective access to orbit for dozens of payloads at once. This latest flight continues a trend where commercial providers increasingly drive Earth observation capabilities, often outpacing government programs in agility and data frequency. For users relying on real-time insights—from climate researchers to shipping logistics teams—these constellations are quietly becoming indispensable infrastructure.

Recent damage to the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad—Russia’s primary facility for crewed missions—has raised questions about the sustainability of Soyuz launches in the near term. With the ISS scheduled for retirement later this decade, any disruption to crew rotation or resupply could complicate the final years of operations. For now, though, life aboard continues: science experiments run, systems are maintained, and ten people float through their carefully choreographed routines, 400 kilometers above a planet that still hasn’t quite figured out how to work together down here.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Over €900 Million Committed to European Launcher Challenge\" - <a href=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/over-e900-million-committed-to-european-launcher-challenge/\">https://europeanspaceflight.com/over-e900-million-committed-to-european-launcher-challenge/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Spire and Planet expand satellite fleets on Transporter 15 mission\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Spire_and_Planet_expand_satellite_fleets_on_Transporter_15_mission_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Spire_and_Planet_expand_satellite_fleets_on_Transporter_15_mission_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"Station 10 as Soyuz crew arrives amid Baikonur launch pad crisis\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Station_10_as_Soyuz_crew_arrives_amid_Baikonur_launch_pad_crisis_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Station_10_as_Soyuz_crew_arrives_amid_Baikonur_launch_pad_crisis_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

Developed under a 2021 contract with France’s Directorate General of Armaments (DGA), SyLEx is designed as a flexible, multi-use suborbital launch system for scientific and defense-related experiments. While ArianeGroup is best known for its heavy-lift Ariane 5 and upcoming Ariane 6 vehicles, SyLEx represents a pivot toward responsive, small-scale missions that can carry payloads above 100 km—the Kármán line—without entering orbit. The flight marks a quiet but significant step in Europe’s growing emphasis on rapid-access launch capabilities, especially as suborbital platforms gain traction for microgravity research, hypersonics testing, and sensor validation. Though not as flashy as orbital launches, suborbital systems like SyLEx are increasingly vital infrastructure for agile aerospace development—kind of like the reliable commuter train of the upper atmosphere.</p>\n\n<h3>Rosalind Franklin Rover Gets NASA Lifeline for 2028 Mars Shot</h3>\n<img src=\"https://www.spxdaily.com/images-bg/mars-exomars-spix-bg.jpg\" alt=\"Artist's rendering of the European Rosalind Franklin Mars rover\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<p>Good news for planetary science: NASA has officially confirmed its continued support for ESA’s long-delayed Rosalind Franklin Mars rover, now targeting a 2028 launch. The rover, named after the pioneering DNA researcher, aims to be the first mission capable of drilling up to two meters beneath the Martian surface—well below the radiation-scorched topsoil—to search for signs of past or present microbial life. Originally slated for a 2022 launch, the mission was derailed by geopolitical tensions that severed ties with Russia’s space agency, which had been providing the launch vehicle and descent module. Since then, ESA has been rebuilding the mission architecture with new international partners. NASA’s renewed backing includes critical contributions like radioisotope heater units to keep the rover warm during frigid Martian nights. If all goes to plan, Rosalind Franklin won’t just advance astrobiology—it’ll also demonstrate Europe’s ability to persevere through complex, multinational setbacks. Mars, it seems, rewards patience more than speed.</p>\n\n<h3>A Ceramic Foam That Laughs at 1,300°C</h3>\n<img src=\"https://www.spxdaily.com/images-bg/semplastics-x-mat-x-foam-ceramic-foam-extreme-environment-burn-resistant-bg.jpg\" alt=\"X-FOAM ceramic foam material glowing under high heat\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<p>Materials science just got a serious upgrade with the introduction of X-FOAM, a new ceramic foam engineered by Florida-based X-MAT. Announced on December 1, 2025, this lightweight material can withstand temperatures up to 1,300°C while maintaining structural integrity—a combination usually reserved for much heavier or more fragile compounds. With a density of just 0.15 g/cc (about one-seventh that of water) and thermal conductivity rivaling high-end aerogels, X-FOAM offers both insulation and compressive strength in the hundreds to thousands of PSI. That makes it ideal for aerospace applications like thermal protection systems, rocket nozzles, or even habitats for lunar or Martian bases. What’s remarkable is its machinability: unlike brittle ceramics, X-FOAM can be shaped with standard tools, opening doors for custom components without exotic manufacturing. In an industry where every gram counts and every degree matters, innovations like this often fly under the radar—until they’re keeping astronauts safe or enabling the next-generation engine. Call it the unsung hero of extreme environments.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"ArianeGroup Launches Inaugural Flight of Suborbital SyLEx Rocket\" - <a href=\"https://europeanspaceflight.com/arianegroup-launches-inaugural-flight-of-suborbital-sylex-rocket/\">https://europeanspaceflight.com/arianegroup-launches-inaugural-flight-of-suborbital-sylex-rocket/</a></li>\n    <li>\"NASA confirms support for delayed European Mars rover: ESA\" - <a href=\"https://www.marsdaily.com/reports/NASA_confirms_support_for_delayed_European_Mars_rover_ESA_999.html\">https://www.marsdaily.com/reports/NASA_confirms_support_for_delayed_European_Mars_rover_ESA_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"X-MAT introduces X-FOAM: A game-changing ceramic foam for extreme environments\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/X-MAT_introduces_X-FOAM_A_game-changing_ceramic_foam_for_extreme_environments_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/X-MAT_introduces_X-FOAM_A_game-changing_ceramic_foam_for_extreme_environments_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

(TSX: CGY) has wrapped up its fiscal year 2025 with record revenue of $774 million—more than triple its 2015 total—and a leadership transition on the horizon. Longtime CEO Kevin Ford is stepping down at year’s end after guiding the company from a Canadian-focused service provider into a global solutions firm with 25% of revenue now derived from products and nearly half its operations outside Canada. In its Q4 results released November 26, 2025, Calian reported a 12% year-over-year revenue increase to $203 million, split evenly between organic growth and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA rose 2% to $24.3 million, while net profit rebounded to $20.6 million from a $0.6 million loss a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Despite a 15% dip in full-year adjusted EBITDA—attributed to underperformance in its IT and Cyber Solutions segment—Ford sees opportunity ahead. He pointed to Canada’s newly announced defence investments as a potential boon for Calian’s healthcare, training, and defence services, though the company remains cautious about baking those prospects into 2026 projections due to uncertain contract timelines. Incoming CEO Patrick Houston emphasized transparency over traditional guidance, instead outlining a long-term goal of 10–15% annual revenue growth fueled by both organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/calian-presentation_q4-2025-slide5-crop2.jpg?resize=780%2C440&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Calian financial presentation slide showing growth metrics\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>UAH Students Shine in International CanSat Competition</h3>\n<p>While Canada wasn’t in the spotlight, student talent from the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) certainly was. Three UAH CanSat teams—BlueStreak, Cosmos, and another unnamed entry—secured first, second, and sixth places in the 2025 International CanSat competition, held across Monterey and Staunton, Virginia. CanSat challenges university teams to design and build soda-can-sized payloads capable of performing real-time atmospheric measurements during a high-altitude balloon or rocket flight. The event, which draws competitors from around the world, tests everything from telemetry and data recovery to parachute deployment and system reliability.</p>\n<p>UAH’s success isn’t just a win for the American South; it reflects the kind of hands-on aerospace education that feeds directly into North America’s broader space ecosystem—including Canada’s own growing need for skilled engineers and technicians. These student-built systems often mirror the constraints and requirements of actual satellite missions, making the competition a proving ground for future industry leaders. Though not a Canadian story per se, it’s a reminder that the pipeline of space talent is continental, and excellence anywhere lifts the field everywhere. And honestly, it’s hard not to cheer for students who can pack a working atmospheric lab into something that wouldn’t look out of place in your recycling bin.</p>\n\n<h3>ISS Makes History with All Eight Ports Occupied</h3>\n<p>In a first for the International Space Station, all eight of its docking and berthing ports are simultaneously occupied as of December 1, 2025. The milestone was achieved after Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus XL cargo spacecraft was reinstalled on the Earth-facing port of the Unity module. The station now hosts an impressive lineup: two SpaceX Crew Dragon vehicles, the aforementioned Cygnus XL, JAXA’s HTV-X1 cargo craft, two Russian Soyuz crew capsules, and two Progress supply ships. This crowded configuration underscores the ISS’s role as a true international hub—though it also requires careful coordination to avoid what astronauts might diplomatically call “parking congestion.”</p>\n<p>The feat highlights the increasing traffic in low Earth orbit, driven by both commercial resupply missions and national crew rotations. While temporary, this full-house scenario demonstrates the station’s operational maturity and the intricate ballet of orbital logistics that keeps it running. With the ISS expected to remain operational until at least 2030, such moments may become more common—though still remarkable. After all, managing eight visiting vehicles isn’t just about docking; it’s about ensuring power, communications, and safety for every single one. It’s a small marvel of engineering and diplomacy, 400 kilometers above our heads.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Calian reports balanced growth with increased revenue as CEO Kevin Ford retires\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/calian-reports-balanced-growth-with-increased-revenue-as-ceo-kevin-ford-retires/\">https://spaceq.ca/calian-reports-balanced-growth-with-increased-revenue-as-ceo-kevin-ford-retires/</a></li>\n    <li>\"UAH CanSat and rover teams notch winning performances in 2025 national and international competitions\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/UAH_CanSat_and_rover_teams_notch_winning_performances_in_2025_national_and_international_competitions_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/UAH_CanSat_and_rover_teams_notch_winning_performances_in_2025_national_and_international_competitions_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"Space Station First: All Docking Ports Fully Occupied, 8 Spacecraft on Orbit\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/spacestation/2025/12/01/space-station-first-all-docking-ports-fully-occupied-8-spacecraft-on-orbit/\">https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/spacestation/2025/12/01/space-station-first-all-docking-ports-fully-occupied-8-spacecraft-on-orbit/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Previously known for its work on launch vehicles and spaceport infrastructure, the company is now expanding into full spacecraft development—a strategic move mirroring industry leaders like SpaceX and Rocket Lab. The SSL features an ISO5 clean room, thermal vacuum chamber, vibration table, and is staffed by engineers with real-world space systems experience.</p>\n<p>The lab’s first project is the self-funded <em>Terra Nova</em> mission, a dual-use satellite designed for both defense and commercial Earth observation. It will carry the Chronos Camera Imager with on-edge AI processing and test NordSpace’s own Zephyr-EP electric propulsion system—small, stackable Hall-effect thrusters generating about 50 millinewtons of thrust. Slated to fly aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-17 rideshare mission no earlier than June 2026, <em>Terra Nova</em> marks a significant milestone for Canada’s growing commercial space sector. As CEO Rahul Goel put it, “Building spacecraft in parallel with our launch vehicles ensures that we can support customers throughout the entire mission lifecycle.” So while other countries chase moonshots, Canada might just be quietly building the next generation of orbital know-how—one clean room at a time.</p>\n\n<h3>JWST Spots Ancient Spiral Galaxy That Shouldn’t Exist</h3>\n<p>In a discovery that could rewrite parts of galaxy formation theory, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified a massive, mature spiral galaxy—dubbed <em>Alaknanda</em>—that existed when the universe was just 1.5 billion years old. Named after a Himalayan river (paired culturally with the Mandakini, the Hindi name for the Milky Way), this galaxy looks remarkably like our own, complete with well-defined spiral arms and a stable disk structure.</p>\n<p>That’s surprising because current models suggest galaxies in the early universe were chaotic, clumpy, and still assembling through violent mergers—not yet settled into orderly spirals. Alaknanda’s existence implies that some galaxies matured far faster than astronomers expected. The discovery was made possible by gravitational lensing from the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster, which magnified Alaknanda’s light enough for JWST’s infrared instruments to resolve its structure. While more observations are needed, this find hints that the cosmic rulebook might need a few footnotes—or perhaps a new chapter. Either way, it’s a reminder that even in a field as precise as astrophysics, the universe loves to keep us humble.</p>\n\n<h3>NASA Tests Mars-Ready Drones in Earth’s Harshest Deserts</h3>\n<p>Before sending autonomous flyers to Mars, NASA is putting them through their paces in some of Earth’s most Mars-like environments—including Death Valley and the Mojave Desert. As part of 25 new technology projects under the Mars Exploration Program, teams are trialing drones, legged robots, and winged flyer concepts to refine navigation software that will one day operate independently on the Red Planet.</p>\n<p>Unlike Earth, Mars lacks GPS, reliable landmarks, and thick atmosphere—making autonomous navigation extremely challenging. These desert trials simulate those conditions by testing how well systems can map terrain, avoid obstacles, and make real-time decisions with minimal human input. The goal is to develop “perception-aware” autonomy that allows future Mars aircraft to explore cliffs, caves, and craters inaccessible to rovers. While today’s tests involve engineers in windblown jackets chasing drones across sand dunes, tomorrow’s missions could feature fleets of aerial scouts relaying data from Martian canyons. It’s not quite <em>The Martian</em>, but it’s close—and it’s all in preparation for a future where Mars exploration takes flight, literally.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"NordSpace announces its Space Systems Lab and provides new details on Terra Nova mission\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/nordspace-announces-its-space-systems-lab-and-provides-new-details-on-terra-nova-mission/\">https://spaceq.ca/nordspace-announces-its-space-systems-lab-and-provides-new-details-on-terra-nova-mission/</a></li>\n    <li>\"JWST spots early Milky Way style spiral galaxy Alaknanda\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/JWST_spots_early_Milky_Way_style_spiral_galaxy_Alaknanda_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/JWST_spots_early_Milky_Way_style_spiral_galaxy_Alaknanda_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"NASA desert drone trials refine navigation software for future Mars explorers\" - <a href=\"https://www.marsdaily.com/reports/NASA_desert_drone_trials_refine_navigation_software_for_future_Mars_explorers_999.html\">https://www.marsdaily.com/reports/NASA_desert_drone_trials_refine_navigation_software_for_future_Mars_explorers_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

Drawing parallels to the automotive and civil aviation industries, Christie suggests that today’s fragmented ecosystem of small component suppliers is unsustainable for an industry that demands high reliability at scale. Early New Space companies, often under-resourced and lacking deep systems engineering experience, are attempting to become vertically integrated out of necessity—but that path is proving treacherous.</p>\n<p>Just as automakers eventually standardized quality through ISO 9000 and aircraft OEMs consolidated around Tier-1 suppliers capable of delivering certified subsystems, Christie predicts a wave of consolidation in space. The market, he contends, will reward those who can consistently deliver disciplined processes—not just clever tech. “Brilliant technology that struggles to scale” won’t cut it when a single faulty reaction wheel can doom an entire mission. The early signs of this shift are already visible, though Christie teases that he’ll unpack those in a future column. For now, the takeaway is clear: space may feel like the Wild West, but physics and economics eventually impose order.</p>\n\n<h3>Pacific Geomatics Brings AI-Powered Image Enhancement to Canadian Clients</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PacGeo_SIAnalytics_MattTaegyun_2.jpg?fit=780%2C439&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Taegyun Jeon, CEO of SI Analytics, and Matt Tomlins, President of Pacific Geomatics\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<p>Ottawa-based satellite imagery reseller Pacific Geomatics (PacGeo) has struck a strategic partnership with South Korea’s SI Analytics to offer SuperX, an AI-driven image super-resolution tool, to Canadian and global clients. SuperX uses generative AI trained on multi-resolution satellite data—from 0.25-meter ultra-high-res to coarse global datasets—to effectively double the resolution of optical imagery, whether fresh or archived.</p>\n<p>Importantly for PacGeo’s clientele—which includes Canada’s Department of National Defence and other federal agencies under National Master Standing Offers—the tool is sensor-agnostic and compatible with PacGeo’s vendor-neutral model. This means clients can enhance existing image archives without commissioning new satellite tasking, potentially reducing costs while improving geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) analysis. According to PacGeo president Matt Tomlins, the deal grants the company Canadian exclusivity for SuperX, making high-resolution insights more accessible across sectors like mining, forestry, energy, and defense. As SI Analytics CEO Taegyun Jeon puts it, the technology enables machines not just to analyze, but to “understand, reconstruct, and predict” Earth surface features—a subtle but significant evolution in how we extract value from space-based data.</p>\n\n<h3>ESA’s Space Safety Programme Gets a Major Funding Boost</h3>\n<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has secured €955 million for its Space Safety programme over the next three years—roughly 30% more than its previous allocation and even exceeding its original request. Approved by member states at the CM25 ministerial council, the funding represents about 4% of ESA’s total triennial budget and fully finances planned activities, including space debris monitoring, planetary defense, and space weather forecasting.</p>\n<p>This injection of capital underscores growing international concern about the sustainability of orbital operations as satellite constellations proliferate. The programme supports missions like Hera (ESA’s asteroid deflection follow-up to NASA’s DART) and the upcoming Vigil space weather observatory. With space becoming increasingly congested and contested, the investment reflects a pragmatic shift: ensuring the long-term usability of near-Earth space is no longer optional. While Canada isn’t an ESA member, the programme’s open data policies and collaborative frameworks often benefit Canadian researchers and commercial entities indirectly—especially as global standards for debris mitigation and collision avoidance take shape. In an era where a single fragmentation event can jeopardize hundreds of satellites, this kind of proactive investment might just be the unsung hero of future space operations.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Fragmentation and consolidation – We have seen this before\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/fragmentation-and-consolidation-we-have-seen-this-before/\">https://spaceq.ca/fragmentation-and-consolidation-we-have-seen-this-before/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Pacific Geomatics adds another AI imagery analysis tool in SuperX\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/pacific-geomatics-adds-another-ai-imagery-analysis-tool-in-superx/\">https://spaceq.ca/pacific-geomatics-adds-another-ai-imagery-analysis-tool-in-superx/</a></li>\n    <li>\"ESA Space Safety programme gains major funding increase\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/ESA_Space_Safety_programme_gains_major_funding_increase_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/ESA_Space_Safety_programme_gains_major_funding_increase_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

According to a recent SpaceNews report, the company received significantly less funding than the other four participants in the European Space Agency’s European Launcher Challenge—largely because the UK government deferred its final funding decision. While competitors in Germany, France, Sweden, and Portugal have moved ahead with development milestones, Orbex’s Prime rocket program now faces delays that could impact its planned debut from the Sutherland spaceport in Scotland.</p>\n<p>This setback matters beyond national pride. Europe is striving to build independent, responsive launch capabilities to reduce reliance on non-European providers. Orbex had been positioned as a key part of that strategy, offering a low-emission, reusable smallsat launcher. But without timely government backing, its timeline—and market relevance—could slip. In an industry where first-mover advantage often dictates survival, Orbex’s hold pattern may prove costly. Still, the company has built strong partnerships and technical credibility; with a clear funding path, recovery remains possible. For now, though, it’s playing catch-up while others accelerate.</p>\n\n<h3>Canadian Firm Wins Luxembourg Contract for Quantum Subsurface Mapper</h3>\n<p>In a win for Canadian quantum innovation, the Canadian Space Mining Corporation (CSMC) has secured a contract from the Luxembourg Space Agency to advance its Quantum Atomic Subsurface Mapper (QASM). This sensor, which combines cold-atom interferometry with artificial intelligence, aims to detect subsurface water and critical minerals—not just on Earth, but potentially on the Moon and other planetary bodies. Originally developed with support from the Ontario Water Consortium, QASM has evolved into a dual-use platform with applications in both terrestrial resource management and space exploration.</p>\n<p>CSMC plans to complete lab validation in 2026, followed by field tests and—eventually—an orbital demonstration “in the next few years.” CEO Daniel Sax called the project a testament to Canada’s growing “quantum advantage,” while Luxembourg’s Bob Lamboray highlighted the transatlantic collaboration as a model for sustainable space resource development. Notably, CSMC is also advancing a Canadian Space Agency–funded Low Enriched Uranium Nuclear Reactor (LEUNR) for lunar and terrestrial use and is a finalist in the CSA/UK Space Agency Aqualunar Challenge. Though the contract value remains undisclosed, the partnership reinforces Canada’s niche in high-precision quantum sensing—a field where theoretical physics meets practical planetary stewardship.</p>\n\n<h3>Canada Invests $47 Million to Keep RADARSAT Eyes in the Sky</h3>\n<p>The Canadian Space Agency has awarded $47 million in contracts to ensure continuity of Canada’s flagship Earth observation capability. Of that, $44.7 million goes to MDA Space to procure long-lead, specialized components for a replenishment satellite in the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). An additional $747,000 is split among MDA Space, Kepler Communications, and C-CORE for early concept studies on a fourth-generation RADARSAT system—the next evolution beyond RCM.</p>\n<p>This move is part of Canada’s broader $1.012 billion, 15-year RADARSAT+ initiative announced in 2023. The goal? To maintain uninterrupted access to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which supports everything from maritime surveillance and disaster response to agricultural monitoring and national security. “We are strengthening Canada’s sovereign satellite capabilities,” said Industry Minister Mélanie Joly. MDA CEO Mike Greenley noted the company will leverage its CHORUS™ satellite design to deliver a cost-effective, timely solution. Given that RADARSAT-1 launched in 1995, this latest investment underscores Canada’s three-decade leadership in radar-based Earth observation—a quiet but vital contribution to global environmental and security efforts.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Orbex trails other European Launcher Challenge companies as U.K. delays funding decision\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/orbex-trails-other-european-launcher-challenge-companies-as-u-k-delays-funding-decision/\">https://spacenews.com/orbex-trails-other-european-launcher-challenge-companies-as-u-k-delays-funding-decision/</a></li>\n    <li>\"CSMC gets Quantum Atomic Subsurface Mapper contract from Luxembourg Space Agency\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/csmc-gets-quantum-atomic-subsurface-mapper-contract-from-luxembourg-space-agency/\">https://spaceq.ca/csmc-gets-quantum-atomic-subsurface-mapper-contract-from-luxembourg-space-agency/</a></li>\n    <li>\"$47 million in contracts awarded for RADARSAT+ initiative\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/47-million-in-contracts-awarded-for-radarsat-initiative/\">https://spaceq.ca/47-million-in-contracts-awarded-for-radarsat-initiative/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Announced on December 6, 2025, the initiative aims to strengthen defence capabilities across all Canadian regions—from Atlantic Canada to the Prairies and the North—by funding innovation, supply chain resilience, and job creation tied to national security. Regional Development Agencies will distribute the funds, with Atlantic Canada already slated to receive nearly $40 million to help local defence firms modernize and compete globally.</p>\n<p>Minister of National Defence David J. McGuinty emphasized that the investment isn’t just about military readiness but also about economic sovereignty: “This is about protecting our sovereignty, fueling economic growth, and ensuring Canada is never caught unprepared.” Notably, the initiative includes the DRDC IDEaS “Launch the North” challenge—a competition encouraging Canadian innovators to develop northern-focused small launch capabilities. With a January 9, 2026 application deadline, this challenge is already influencing decisions by domestic space companies.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nordspace_taiga_on_pad-4x3-1.jpg?fit=780%2C585&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"NordSpace Taiga suborbital launch vehicle on the launch pad\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>NordSpace Delays Taiga Launch to Focus on Orbital Ambitions</h3>\n<p>Canadian launch startup NordSpace has pushed back its Taiga suborbital test flight—originally scheduled for mid-December 2025—from the Atlantic Spaceport Complex in Newfoundland. The new target is no earlier than March 2026. While weather played a role, the company cited a more strategic reason: the upcoming DRDC IDEaS “Launch the North” challenge. With applications due January 9, 2026, NordSpace says it’s reallocating engineering resources to refine its orbital-scale technologies, including engines, tanks, and launch procedures, to submit a competitive proposal.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first delay for Taiga; a September attempt was scrubbed due to a fuel issue. Meanwhile, NordSpace continues development of its Tundra orbital launch vehicle, designed for rapid deployment from just a few standard shipping containers—a feature aimed at responsive launch capabilities. The company recently completed a high-fidelity trajectory and flight dynamics model for Tundra after two years of simulations and physical testing. Though the Taiga delay is a pause, not a pivot, it underscores how government challenges are shaping Canada’s emerging launch ecosystem, turning short-term setbacks into long-term strategy.</p>\n\n<h3>SpaceX Clears Environmental Hurdle for Starship at SLC-37</h3>\n<p>SpaceX has received environmental approval to launch its Starship vehicle from Space Launch Complex 37 (SLC-37) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The approval follows completion of the required Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process, marking a key milestone in the company’s plan to diversify Starship launch operations beyond its Starbase facility in Texas. SLC-37—historically used for Delta IV launches—will be modified to support the massive fully reusable rocket system.</p>\n<p>This move enhances SpaceX’s launch flexibility, particularly for missions requiring specific orbital inclinations or those needing rapid turnaround between government, commercial, or NASA flights. With Starship central to NASA’s Artemis lunar landing plans, having a second U.S. East Coast launch site could prove critical for meeting ambitious timelines. The environmental clearance doesn’t guarantee immediate construction or launches, but it removes a major regulatory barrier. As Starship continues its test campaign, this approval signals growing infrastructure maturity for the world’s most powerful rocket—on both coasts.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Government of Canada invests $357.7 million to kickstart the Regional Defence Investment Initiative\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/government-of-canada-invests-357-7-million-to-kickstart-the-regional-defence-investment-initiative/\">https://spaceq.ca/government-of-canada-invests-357-7-million-to-kickstart-the-regional-defence-investment-initiative/</a></li>\n    <li>\"NordSpace postpones Taiga suborbital launch until March 2026\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/nordspace-postpones-taiga-suborbital-launch-until-march-2026/\">https://spaceq.ca/nordspace-postpones-taiga-suborbital-launch-until-march-2026/</a></li>\n    <li>\"SpaceX gets Environmental Approval for Starship at SLC-37\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2025/12/spacex-environmental-approval-starship-slc-37/\">https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2025/12/spacex-environmental-approval-starship-slc-37/</a></li>\n</ul>",

This December, the agency’s Scientific Balloon Program will launch two zero-pressure balloons from near McMurdo Station on the Ross Ice Shelf. These high-altitude platforms will carry the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) and the General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS)—instruments designed to detect ultrahigh-energy neutrinos and low-energy antiparticles, respectively. Both aim to shed light on dark matter and cosmic ray origins, leveraging Antarctica’s stable wind patterns that allow balloons to circle the pole for weeks. While satellites often grab headlines, balloon-based experiments offer a cost-effective alternative for testing cutting-edge detectors before committing to orbital missions. In this case, PUEO and GAPS could deliver insights that complement data from space telescopes and ground-based observatories—proving that sometimes, the best view of the cosmos comes from a very cold, very windy patch of ice.</p>\n\n<h3>Digital Twin Takes Flight Aboard Proteus Satellite</h3>\n<p>Last week, a novel piece of aerospace software hitched a ride to orbit: a dynamic digital twin developed by researchers at UC Davis. Launched aboard a SpaceX rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base on November 28, the twin is now operational on a Proteus Space satellite, where it will continuously model and predict the health of the spacecraft’s power system in real time. Unlike static simulations, this digital twin adapts to actual conditions in space, using live telemetry to forecast potential failures or performance degradations. This marks the first time such a system has been deployed in orbit, potentially setting a new standard for spacecraft autonomy and maintenance. For mission operators—especially those managing large satellite constellations—this could mean fewer surprises and longer mission lifespans. Think of it as a spacecraft’s own onboard mechanic, always on duty and never needing coffee (though we still recommend coffee for the humans on the ground).</p>\n\n<h3>Artemis IV to Deploy New Lunar Science Instruments</h3>\n<p>As NASA gears up for the Artemis IV mission, slated to land near the Moon’s south pole, the agency has selected two new science instruments for astronauts to deploy on the lunar surface. These tools—a dust-monitoring station and a seismic sensor—will help characterize the local environment, addressing critical unknowns about regolith behavior and subsurface structure. Understanding lunar dust is more than academic curiosity; its abrasive, clingy nature poses challenges for equipment, habitats, and even astronaut suits. Meanwhile, seismic data could reveal whether the Moon remains tectonically active and help map subsurface ice deposits. According to Nicky Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, these investigations are vital stepping stones not only for sustained lunar presence but also for future Mars missions. Artemis IV, currently targeted for no earlier than 2028, continues to shape up as a pivotal mission that blends exploration with practical science—making sure we don’t just visit the Moon, but learn how to live there.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"NASA prepares long duration Antarctic balloon campaign to probe neutrinos and dark matter\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/NASA_prepares_long_duration_Antarctic_balloon_campaign_to_probe_neutrinos_and_dark_matter_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/NASA_prepares_long_duration_Antarctic_balloon_campaign_to_probe_neutrinos_and_dark_matter_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"Digital twin successfully launched and deployed into space\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/UC_Davis_Designed_Digital_Twin_Successfully_Launched_and_Deployed_into_Space_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/UC_Davis_Designed_Digital_Twin_Successfully_Launched_and_Deployed_into_Space_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"NASA prepares new lunar dust and seismic studies for Artemis IV\" - <a href=\"https://www.moondaily.com/reports/NASA_prepares_new_lunar_dust_and_seismic_studies_for_Artemis_IV_999.html\">https://www.moondaily.com/reports/NASA_prepares_new_lunar_dust_and_seismic_studies_for_Artemis_IV_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

The <em>Defence Enhanced Surveillance from Space Project</em> and the <em>Enhanced Satellite Communications Project</em> are now under the DIA’s purview, though neither is new; both have evolved through various iterations since as early as 2007. Originally conceptualized as the Polar Communications and Weather initiative—a civil-military hybrid—the satellite communications effort has since been reoriented to meet modern Arctic defence needs.</p>\n<p>Also noteworthy is the Arctic Over-the-Horizon Radar (A-OTHR), listed under “air” but deeply relevant to Canada’s northern surveillance strategy. The government previously announced partnerships with Australia to adapt their OTHR tech and has identified two Ontario sites: a permanent transmitter north of Kawartha Lakes and a preliminary receiver in Clearview Township. While not space-based, A-OTHR relies on ionospheric reflection to detect targets up to 3,000 km away—showcasing how terrestrial and space-based systems increasingly intertwine in Canada’s national security architecture.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fig-1-a-othr-concept_16x9.jpg?resize=780%2C438&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Arctic Over-the-Horizon Radar concept diagram\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Orion’s Final Prep for Artemis II Under Branelle Rodriguez’s Watch</h3>\n<p>As the Artemis II mission edges closer to its 2026 launch, NASA’s Orion spacecraft is undergoing its final integration phases at Kennedy Space Center. Overseeing this complex ballet of components is Branelle Rodriguez, the Artemis II vehicle manager for the Orion Program. Her role involves coordinating the movement of hardware that has crisscrossed North America—through facilities in Texas, Ohio, and beyond—before final assembly in Florida. With Artemis II set to carry four astronauts on a lunar flyby, it will be the first crewed mission to orbit the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez’s leadership ensures that each subsystem—from life support to thermal protection—is rigorously tested and verified. The stakes are high: this mission serves as the ultimate dress rehearsal before Artemis III lands humans on the lunar surface. Every bolt tightened and interface checked under her supervision brings the program one step closer to that historic “go” for launch. While much of the fanfare focuses on astronauts and rockets, it’s the meticulous work behind the scenes that turns ambition into reality—something Rodriguez and her team embody daily.</p>\n\n<h3>Menstrual Cup Endures Spaceflight: A Small Step for Period Care, Giant Leap for Inclusivity</h3>\n<p>Managing menstruation in microgravity just got a little easier—thanks to an off-the-shelf menstrual cup. A new study led by astrobiologist Ligia Coelho of Cornell University’s Carl Sagan Institute demonstrates that standard silicone menstrual cups can withstand the rigors of spaceflight, including radiation exposure and temperature swings. The research, conducted under the volunteer initiative AstroCup, offers a practical, reusable, and waste-minimizing option for female astronauts on long-duration missions.</p>\n<p>Historically, NASA advised astronauts to suppress menstruation using hormonal contraceptives—a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn’t suit everyone. Coelho’s findings validate menstrual cups as a viable alternative, aligning with broader efforts to make spaceflight more inclusive and adaptable to diverse physiological needs. While it might sound mundane, this work addresses a real logistical and health consideration for missions to the Moon and beyond. After all, if we’re serious about sending humans on multi-year journeys to Mars, we can’t overlook the everyday realities of human biology—period.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"First Defence Investment Agency priority procurements revealed\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/first-defence-investment-agency-priority-procurements-revealed/\">https://spaceq.ca/first-defence-investment-agency-priority-procurements-revealed/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Artemis II Vehicle Manager Branelle Rodriguez Gets Orion Ready for “Go”\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/johnson/artemis-ii-vehicle-manager-branelle-rodriguez-gets-orion-ready-for-go/\">https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/johnson/artemis-ii-vehicle-manager-branelle-rodriguez-gets-orion-ready-for-go/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Space tested menstrual cup backs astronaut health on long missions\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Space_tested_menstrual_cup_backs_astronaut_health_on_long_missions_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Space_tested_menstrual_cup_backs_astronaut_health_on_long_missions_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

In a newly issued Request for Information (RFI), the CSA seeks detailed technical and operational data on CubeSat platforms currently available or in development within Canada. The goal? To better understand what homegrown capabilities exist for future missions. Questions range from flight heritage and design life to propulsion systems, ADCS performance, star tracker specs, and even heat dissipation capacity. The RFI also asks about documentation standards, certification test data, and rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) costs—strictly for the bus, not the payload. While not a procurement solicitation, this step signals the CSA’s intent to build a reliable national inventory of small satellite expertise. Responses are due by December 23, 2025, at 4:00 p.m. EST. For Canadian universities and startups already dabbling in CubeSat design, this could be a quiet but meaningful doorway into future CSA partnerships. After all, when you’re asking about reaction wheels and CCSDS compliance in the same breath, you’re clearly speaking the language of serious spaceflight—not just student projects.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-10.png?fit=780%2C439&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Canadian Space Agency CubeSat illustration\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Orbital Data Centers Heat Up—Literally and Figuratively</h3>\n<p>As Earth-bound data centers guzzle power to feed the AI boom, a new breed of space startup is looking skyward for solutions. Aetherflux, a company originally focused on space-based solar power, has now entered the orbital data center race—joining the likes of SpaceX and Amazon in exploring off-world computing infrastructure. The idea is compelling: in orbit, sunlight is uninterrupted, and waste heat can theoretically radiate more efficiently into the cold vacuum of space. But the plan isn’t without its complications. A separate report from Space Daily highlights the growing concern over space debris, which threatens not just satellites but any large-scale orbital infrastructure, including floating server farms. Google’s rumored orbital AI ambitions, for instance, could run into the Kessler Syndrome wall before they ever achieve a single floating-point operation in space. Aetherflux hasn’t released technical specifics yet, but merging solar power generation with high-performance computing in a single platform—if feasible—could redefine how we think about energy and computation beyond Earth. Just don’t expect your cloud backups to be stored in LEO anytime soon.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/aetherflux.jpg?fit=1024%2C575&ssl=1\" alt=\"Aetherflux orbital data center concept\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>The Spacecraft Cleanroom’s Unshakeable Stowaway</h3>\n<p>Even the cleanest rooms on Earth have secrets—and one of them is a bacterium that absolutely refuses to wake up. Researchers have taken a closer look at <em>Tersicoccus phoenicis</em>, a microbe first identified in the ultra-sterile cleanrooms used by NASA and the European Space Agency to assemble spacecraft. What makes this bug remarkable isn’t its presence—it’s its persistence. <em>T. phoenicis</em> can enter an extreme dormant state, effectively “shutting down” so completely that standard cleaning protocols can’t coax it into activity or eliminate it. This poses a planetary protection headache: if such resilient microbes hitch a ride on a Mars-bound lander, they could theoretically survive the journey and confuse future life-detection experiments. The new study doesn’t suggest the bacterium is dangerous—just stubbornly hardy. It’s a reminder that even as we reach for the stars, Earth’s tiniest tenants are still finding ways to tag along. And while we’re busy building AI data centers in orbit, these microbes are quietly winning the long game of interplanetary stowaway bingo—no ticket required.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.spxdaily.com/images-bg/tersicoccus-phoenicis-clean-room-bacteria-bg.jpg\" alt=\"Tersicoccus phoenicis bacteria in spacecraft cleanroom\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Want to build a CubeSat for the CSA?

Slated for full operational service in early 2026, TraCSS aims to bring order to the increasingly cluttered low Earth orbit by coordinating satellite traffic and preventing collisions. LeoLabs, known for its global network of ground-based radar systems, will now help track not just debris but also adversarial spacecraft that may pose strategic risks. This move reflects growing concerns about the dual-use nature of modern satellites—technologies that can shift from peaceful observation to disruptive operations with minimal warning. While the U.S. government hasn’t named specific threats, recent activities by Russia and China, including the deployment of objects like COSMOS-2570’s subsatellites, have heightened scrutiny. LeoLabs’ real-time tracking capabilities could offer critical transparency in an era where space is no longer a benign frontier but a contested domain.</p>\n\n<h3>Reframing the Lunar Race: Beyond National Footraces</h3>\n<p>As nations plot their return to the Moon, a growing chorus of experts urges the U.S. to stop viewing China’s lunar ambitions as a sprint to plant flags. A recent analysis warns that Beijing’s strategy isn’t just about prestige—it’s part of a broader, systematic effort to dominate critical infrastructure, resources, and strategic positions, now extended into cislunar space. Unlike the Cold War–era space race, which was largely symbolic, today’s lunar push ties directly into long-term economic and security interests, including access to water ice and rare minerals. The article argues that framing this as a “footrace” oversimplifies the stakes and risks triggering unnecessary escalation. Instead, it calls for a more nuanced approach—one that combines international collaboration, regulatory frameworks, and sustainable exploration. For countries like Canada, which is contributing the Canadarm3 to NASA’s Gateway station, this evolving landscape means balancing partnership with strategic foresight. After all, the Moon isn’t just a destination; it’s becoming a new arena for geopolitical and technological influence.</p>\n\n<h3>CSA Seeks Canadian CubeSat Expertise Through New RFI</h3>\n<p>Want to build a CubeSat for the Canadian Space Agency? Better brush up on your specs—because the CSA just dropped a 19-question Request for Information (RFI) aimed at mapping domestic capabilities. The agency is seeking detailed technical data from Canadian suppliers on everything from bus size (6U, 12U, 16U, etc.) and power budgets to propulsion systems, attitude control, and flight heritage. The RFI, open until December 23, 2025, isn’t a procurement call just yet; it’s a fact-finding mission to understand what Canada’s smallsat ecosystem can realistically deliver. This move signals the CSA’s intent to lean more heavily on homegrown innovation, especially as CubeSats become vital tools for Earth observation, tech demonstration, and educational missions. For Canadian universities and startups, it’s a chance to showcase their work and potentially shape future agency programs. And yes—there’s even a question about typical non-binding costs, so the CSA is clearly thinking about budget realities too. If you’ve got a cleanroom and a breadboard, now’s the time to speak up.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"LeoLabs lands interagency contract to feed TraCSS and track adversarial spacecraft\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/leolabs-lands-interagency-contract-to-feed-tracss-and-track-adversarial-spacecraft/\">https://spacenews.com/leolabs-lands-interagency-contract-to-feed-tracss-and-track-adversarial-spacecraft/</a></li>\n    <li>\"America must stop treating China’s lunar plans as a footrace\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/america-must-stop-treating-chinas-lunar-plans-as-a-footrace/\">https://spacenews.com/america-must-stop-treating-chinas-lunar-plans-as-a-footrace/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Want to build a CubeSat for the CSA?

The service—now available to customers south of the 58th parallel in areas without cellular or Wi-Fi—supports text messaging and five key apps: WhatsApp (for voice and video calls), Google Maps, AccuWeather, X (formerly Twitter), and CalTopo for topographic mapping. More apps are expected as developers optimize for satellite connectivity.</p>\n<p>Notably, Rogers becomes the first telecom in Canada to offer such a service commercially. Depending on their plan, Rogers subscribers may access it at no extra cost, while users of other carriers can subscribe for $15 per month.

As one Rogers executive put it, “No one covers Canada like Rogers”—a claim that now quite literally extends into orbit.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/rogers_satellite_to_mobile_16x9.jpg?fit=780%2C439&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Rogers satellite-to-mobile coverage map\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Solar Neutrinos Flip Carbon Atoms in Canadian Underground Lab</h3>\n<p>Deep beneath the Canadian Shield, in a repurposed nickel mine near Sudbury, Ontario, scientists have recorded a rare interaction between solar neutrinos and carbon atoms. Using the SNO+ detector—successor to the Nobel Prize–winning Sudbury Neutrino Observatory—researchers observed solar neutrinos transforming carbon-13 nuclei into nitrogen-13. This marks the first time this specific neutrino-carbon reaction has been documented.</p>\n<p>Neutrinos, often called “ghost particles,” stream through Earth by the trillions every second but rarely interact with matter. Detecting them requires extreme sensitivity and shielding from cosmic interference—conditions uniquely met 2 km underground at SNOLAB. The observation not only validates decades of theoretical physics but also improves our understanding of solar fusion processes. Given Canada’s long-standing role in neutrino research, this discovery reinforces the nation’s quiet but critical contribution to fundamental space science—proving that sometimes, the biggest cosmic insights come from deep underground.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.spxdaily.com/images-bg/canada-sudbury-neutrino-observatory-cavity-detector-bg.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of the SNO+ detector cavity at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Canada\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Mars Science Goals Get Official Endorsement</h3>\n<p>A new report from the U.S. National Academies has laid out a clear scientific priority for future human missions to Mars: the search for past or present life. Released this week, the document stresses that while Mars exploration has many objectives—geology, climate history, human survival—the highest scientific value lies in answering whether life ever emerged on the Red Planet.</p>\n<p>The report recommends maximizing astronaut-scientist collaboration, equipping missions with sample-return capabilities, and targeting regions with high biosignature potential, such as ancient river deltas or subsurface ice deposits. It also underscores the need for planetary protection protocols to avoid contaminating Mars with Earth microbes. With NASA and international partners ramping up plans for crewed Mars missions in the 2030s, this guidance could shape everything from rover design to astronaut training. As one panel member noted, “Finding life—or conclusively ruling it out—would be one of humanity’s greatest scientific achievements.” Either way, Mars remains the ultimate destination for answering that age-old question: are we alone?</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/0412_mars_0.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&ssl=1\" alt=\"Artist's concept of astronauts on Mars\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Rogers Satellite service exits trial and supports more apps\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/rogers-satellite-service-exits-trial-and-supports-more-apps/\">https://spaceq.ca/rogers-satellite-service-exits-trial-and-supports-more-apps/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Solar ghost particles seen flipping carbon atoms in underground detector\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Solar_ghost_particles_seen_flipping_carbon_atoms_in_underground_detector_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Solar_ghost_particles_seen_flipping_carbon_atoms_in_underground_detector_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"Report identifies science objectives of human Mars exploration\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/report-identifies-science-objectives-of-human-mars-exploration/\">https://spacenews.com/report-identifies-science-objectives-of-human-mars-exploration/</a></li>\n</ul>",

But as SpaceNews reports, there’s growing concern within the space community that Plan A might be running out of runway. Delays in Artemis program components, including the Human Landing System and next-gen spacesuits, are piling up, and Congress has made it clear that ceding the Moon to China isn’t an option. What’s missing? A credible Plan B. Experts argue that without parallel development paths or accelerated alternatives—like leveraging commercial capabilities—the U.S. risks missing its window entirely. The stakes go beyond prestige: lunar presence is increasingly tied to strategic influence and future deep-space infrastructure. As one insider put it, “Hoping everything goes perfectly isn’t a strategy—it’s a prayer.” With the clock ticking, NASA and its partners may need to embrace redundancy, not just in hardware, but in timelines and partnerships. After all, when racing against geopolitical rivals, it’s better to have two rockets than one.</p>\n\n<h3>Rogers Brings Satellite Connectivity to Everyday Canadians</h3>\n<p>Rogers has officially launched its satellite-to-mobile service nationwide, moving past its trial phase that began in July 2025. Now, Canadians south of the 58th parallel—who find themselves without cellular or Wi-Fi—can send texts and use a growing suite of apps directly via satellite. The initial lineup includes WhatsApp (for voice and video calls), Google Maps, AccuWeather, X, and CalTopo. More apps are expected as developers optimize their software for low-bandwidth satellite links. The service is free for select Rogers plans, while customers of other carriers can subscribe for $15 per month. Notably, Rogers is the first Canadian telecom to offer this capability at scale, though Bell and Telus are expected to follow in 2026, with Telus partnering with Quebec-based TerreStar Solutions. This marks a quiet but significant leap in Canada’s space-enabled infrastructure—no flashy rockets required, just reliable connectivity where it’s needed most: the remote stretches of highways, forests, and coastlines that define so much of our geography. As CEO Tony Staffieri quipped, “No one covers Canada like Rogers”—and now, that coverage literally comes from space.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.spxdaily.com/images-bg/canada-sudbury-neutrino-observatory-cavity-detector-bg.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of the SNO+ neutrino detector located 2 km underground in Sudbury, Ontario\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Canadian Lab Captures Elusive Solar “Ghost Particles” in Action</h3>\n<p>In a quiet cavity two kilometers underground near Sudbury, Ontario, scientists have observed something never seen before: solar neutrinos flipping carbon atoms. The SNO+ (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory+) detector, located in the former Creighton Mine, recorded neutrinos from the Sun transforming carbon-13 nuclei into nitrogen-13—a rare interaction that confirms long-standing theoretical predictions. Neutrinos, often called “ghost particles,” stream through Earth by the trillions every second but rarely interact with matter, making this detection a triumph of sensitivity and patience. The finding not only deepens our understanding of solar fusion but also validates SNO+’s capabilities as it transitions from studying neutrinos to searching for neutrinoless double beta decay—a potential key to why the universe has more matter than antimatter. This achievement underscores Canada’s quiet but vital role in fundamental physics. While others chase headlines with rockets and rovers, Canadian researchers continue to unlock cosmic secrets from deep beneath our own bedrock—proving that sometimes, the most profound space discoveries happen right here on Earth.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"The U.S. race to the moon: Why Plan B cannot wait\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/the-u-s-race-to-the-moon-why-plan-b-cannot-wait/\">https://spacenews.com/the-u-s-race-to-the-moon-why-plan-b-cannot-wait/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Rogers Satellite service exits trial and supports more apps\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/rogers-satellite-service-exits-trial-and-supports-more-apps/\">https://spaceq.ca/rogers-satellite-service-exits-trial-and-supports-more-apps/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Solar ghost particles seen flipping carbon atoms in underground detector\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Solar_ghost_particles_seen_flipping_carbon_atoms_in_underground_detector_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Solar_ghost_particles_seen_flipping_carbon_atoms_in_underground_detector_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

In a recent interview with SpaceQ, Gibbons detailed the rigorous daily regimen shared by all six crew members—four prime and two backups—as they ready themselves for what remains a developmental mission. “We’re all prepared to fly,” she emphasized. Training includes mastering every Orion spacecraft system, troubleshooting emergencies, and rehearsing nominal mission tasks like lunar flyby observations and proximity operations with the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS). A mechanical engineer and combustion scientist selected by the Canadian Space Agency in 2017, Gibbons spends her days in classrooms, simulators, and procedure reviews, often collaborating with NASA counterparts in Houston. Unlike routine International Space Station operations, Artemis II demands that crews help write the playbook in real time—developing flight rules, suit-donning protocols, and communication strategies from scratch. “We’re taking a really good first stab at it,” she said, acknowledging that true validation will only come once the spacecraft is in flight. With a potential launch as early as February 2026, Gibbons’ role underscores Canada’s deep commitment to lunar exploration—and its readiness to step in if needed.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Jenni-Gibbons-takes-part-in-Artemis-II-simulation-crop.jpg?resize=780%2C438&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Jenni Gibbons in Orion mockup during simulation\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>ESA Astronaut Pablo Álvarez Fernández Dives into Spacesuit Survival Training</h3>\n<p>Preparing for a spacewalk is no walk in the park—especially when your spacesuit weighs 145 kilograms and you’re training underwater. ESA astronaut Pablo Álvarez Fernández recently pulled back the curtain on his grueling yet fascinating path toward a potential mission assignment. In a new ESA Explores video, Fernández describes his journey from the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where much of his hands-on training occurs. Neutral buoyancy labs simulate microgravity, allowing astronauts to rehearse extravehicular activities while encased in bulky suits that replicate the real thing. Beyond spacewalks, Fernández practices responding to onboard emergencies like fires or toxic ammonia leaks—scenarios where calm under pressure is non-negotiable. He also highlights the importance of teamwork, noting that mission success hinges on seamless coordination between international crews and ground control. Though he hasn’t yet been assigned to a specific flight, Fernández remains focused on mastering every contingency. His reflections offer a grounded (if slightly soggy) reminder that behind every orbital hero is years of meticulous, often repetitive preparation—much of it done in a pool wearing what amounts to a wearable submarine.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/videos/2025/12/pablo_alvarez_fernandez_spacesuits_survival_spacewalk_dreams_esa_explores_18/27013212-1-eng-GB/Pablo_Alvarez_Fernandez_Spacesuits_Survival_Spacewalk_Dreams_ESA_Explores_18_card_full.png\" alt=\"ESA astronaut Pablo Álvarez Fernández in spacesuit training\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Hubble Captures a Dwarf Galaxy Lit by Stellar Giants</h3>\n<p>Amid the vast cosmic expanse, even small galaxies can shine brilliantly—if they’re studded with massive, luminous stars. The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope recently turned its eye toward Markarian 178 (Mrk 178), a blue-hued dwarf galaxy located 13 million light-years away in Ursa Major. Dwarf galaxies like Mrk 178 are typically less than a tenth the size of the Milky Way, but this one punches above its weight class thanks to an abundance of hot, young, massive stars. These stellar powerhouses emit intense ultraviolet radiation, ionizing surrounding gas and giving the galaxy its characteristic blue glow. Mrk 178 is part of a catalog of over 1,500 Markarian galaxies—objects identified in the mid-20th century for their strong ultraviolet emissions, often signaling active star formation. Hubble’s sharp vision reveals intricate structures within the galaxy, from glowing nebulae to dark dust lanes, offering astronomers clues about how small galaxies evolve and contribute to the broader galactic ecosystem. While it may lack the grand spiral arms of its larger cousins, Mrk 178 reminds us that in astronomy, size isn’t everything—sometimes, the brightest sparks come from the smallest packages.</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/missions/hubble/galaxies/dwarf/Hubble_Markarian178_potw2549a.jpg\" alt=\"Hubble image of dwarf galaxy Markarian 178\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Jenni Gibbons is prepared to fly\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/jenni-gibbons-is-prepared-to-fly/\">https://spaceq.ca/jenni-gibbons-is-prepared-to-fly/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Pablo Álvarez Fernández | Spacesuits, Survival & Spacewalk Dreams | ESA Explores #18\" - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2025/12/Pablo_Alvarez_Fernandez_Spacesuits_Survival_Spacewalk_Dreams_ESA_Explores_18\">https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2025/12/Pablo_Alvarez_Fernandez_Spacesuits_Survival_Spacewalk_Dreams_ESA_Explores_18</a></li>\n    <li>\"Massive Stars Make Their Mark in Hubble Image\" - <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/massive-stars-make-their-mark-in-hubble-image/\">https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/massive-stars-make-their-mark-in-hubble-image/</a></li>\n</ul>",

Researchers using the SNO+ detector at SNOLAB have, for the first time, observed interactions between solar neutrinos and carbon-13 nuclei, a breakthrough that opens new windows into nuclear and particle physics. Neutrinos, nicknamed “ghost particles” for their near-invisible interactions with matter, are produced in the Sun’s core by the trillions, streaming through our bodies every second without a trace. The SNO+ team identified these elusive encounters using a clever “delayed coincidence” technique: they looked for an initial flash when a neutrino struck carbon-13, followed minutes later by a second flash as the resulting nitrogen-13 decayed. Over a 231-day span from May to June 2023, they recorded 5.6 such events—statistically matching the 4.7 expected from solar neutrino activity. Lead author Gulliver Milton, a PhD student at Oxford, called the result “an extraordinary achievement,” while SNOLAB scientist Dr. Christine Kraus noted it represents the lowest-energy observation of this specific neutrino interaction to date. The work, published in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> on December 10, 2025, underscores Canada’s quiet but critical role in foundational space science—even when the lab is under a nickel mine.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SNOLAB-console16x9.jpg?resize=780%2C439&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Event display console in the SNO+ control room at SNOLAB\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>NASA’s Roman Telescope to Chart the Milky Way in Unprecedented Detail</h3>\n<p>If you’ve ever wished for a Google Maps of the galaxy, NASA’s got you covered—sort of. The agency has unveiled detailed plans for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope’s Galactic Plane Survey, an ambitious effort to map the dense core of our Milky Way with stunning clarity. Scheduled to run over two years with just one month of actual observation time, the survey aims to reveal tens of billions of stars, along with dust clouds, stellar nurseries, and other structures that have remained hidden due to crowding and obscuration. Unlike Hubble, which focuses on deep but narrow fields, Roman will combine a wide field of view with high resolution—think Hubble’s sharpness with a panoramic lens. “This survey will transform our understanding of the galaxy’s structure and evolution,” said a Roman team scientist. The data could help astronomers trace the Milky Way’s formation history, locate hidden black holes, and even refine models of dark matter distribution. While the telescope won’t launch until later this decade, the survey design is now finalized, and anticipation is building among astrophysicists who’ve long struggled to see through the galactic “fog” of the plane. For those of us stargazing from cottage country or city rooftops, Roman’s eventual sky maps may one day make backyard astronomy feel a little more like navigating home—with a cosmic GPS.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/roman-galacticplanesurvey-final-1.jpg\" alt=\"Artist's rendering of the Milky Way's galactic plane as it will be observed by the Roman Space Telescope\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Starship Preparations Heat Up at Florida’s Roberts Road Facility</h3>\n<p>While Canada peers into the quantum shadows of solar ghosts, SpaceX is busy building the future of heavy-lift launch capability—on Florida’s Space Coast. The company’s Roberts Road facility has become the nerve center for East Coast Starship operations, according to a recent report from NASASpaceFlight.com. This site, nestled near Kennedy Space Center, is where SpaceX is assembling and testing hardware for upcoming Starship launches, including potential missions supporting NASA’s Artemis lunar program. Unlike the Starbase facility in Texas, which handles early prototypes and flight tests, Roberts Road is being configured for more mature vehicle processing—think final integration, payload encapsulation, and launch readiness checks. Recent infrastructure upgrades include expanded cryogenic storage, new integration towers, and upgraded roadways to move massive components. Though no specific launch date has been announced for a Florida-based Starship flight, the ramp-up signals SpaceX’s intent to establish dual launch corridors for its next-generation rocket. For observers in the Maritimes or Eastern Canada, a future Roberts Road launch could offer a distant but spectacular view—weather and trajectory permitting. Until then, the facility stands as a testament to how quickly space infrastructure can evolve when ambition meets asphalt (and a lot of steel).</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NSF-2025-12-13-02-48-14-270.jpg\" alt=\"SpaceX Roberts Road facility on Florida's Space Coast with Starship hardware visible\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Researchers observe Sun's 'ghost particles' for the first time in breakthrough using SNOLAB detector\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/researchers-observe-suns-ghost-particles-for-the-first-time-in-breakthrough-using-snolab-detector/\">https://spaceq.ca/researchers-observe-suns-ghost-particles-for-the-first-time-in-breakthrough-using-snolab-detector/</a></li>\n    <li>\"NASA Announces Plan to Map Milky Way With Roman Space Telescope\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/roman-space-telescope/nasa-announces-plan-to-map-milky-way-with-roman-space-telescope/\">https://www.nasa.gov/missions/roman-space-telescope/nasa-announces-plan-to-map-milky-way-with-roman-space-telescope/</a></li>\n    <li>\"SpaceX Roberts Road a focal point for East Coast Starship preparations\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2025/12/spacex-roberts-road-east-coast-starship/\">https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2025/12/spacex-roberts-road-east-coast-starship/</a></li>\n</ul>",

The spacecraft last communicated as expected before slipping behind Mars during a routine orbital pass on December 6, 2025. Such occultations are normal; Mars regularly blocks line-of-sight between Earth and its orbiters. But unlike past events, MAVEN didn’t reappear on schedule afterward.</p>\n<p>Before the blackout, telemetry showed all systems functioning within normal parameters. That makes the silence puzzling—and concerning. MAVEN has been studying Mars’ upper atmosphere since 2014, playing a dual role as both a science platform and a communications relay for surface missions like Perseverance. If the issue persists, it could affect data downlink from the rover. Teams at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and Lockheed Martin are troubleshooting, using deep space network antennas to listen for any signal. While spacecraft occasionally recover after unexpected glitches, the longer the silence lasts, the more uncertain the prognosis becomes. For now, the red planet keeps its secrets—and MAVEN’s fate—just out of reach.</p>\n\n<h3>Canada Joins International Effort to Decode Meteorite Scars</h3>\n<p>A collaborative team of researchers from Canada, China, and Japan has developed a new method to read the violent pasts of rare meteorites known as enstatite chondrites. Using micro X-ray diffraction, scientists can now quantify the shock pressures these space rocks endured during ancient collisions in the early solar system. The technique offers a clearer window into the dynamic conditions that shaped planetary building blocks—especially those chemically akin to Earth’s own composition.</p>\n<p>Enstatite chondrites are unusual: they formed in highly reducing (oxygen-poor) environments close to the infant Sun. Their chemistry closely matches Earth’s bulk composition, making them invaluable time capsules. By analyzing microscopic deformations in mineral structures, the team reconstructed impact histories otherwise invisible to the naked eye. Canadian contributions to the project—though not detailed in the report—highlight the country’s ongoing role in planetary science, often through quiet but vital participation in international collaborations. It’s a reminder that while Canada may not launch its own meteorite-hunting missions, its scientists are very much in the room when cosmic puzzles get solved.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.spxdaily.com/images-bg/parker-solar-probe-artwork-bg.jpg\" alt=\"Artist's impression of NASA's Parker Solar Probe near the Sun\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Parker Solar Probe Catches the Sun Making a U-Turn</h3>\n<p>In its closest approach yet—just 7 million kilometers from the Sun’s surface in December 2024—NASA’s Parker Solar Probe spotted something unexpected: solar wind doing a literal U-turn. Data and imagery from the mission reveal that magnetic structures in the Sun’s corona don’t always stream smoothly outward. Sometimes, they loop back toward the surface before escaping, like solar traffic reversing lanes during rush hour.</p>\n<p>These “switchbacks,” as they’re called, have intrigued scientists since earlier Parker flybys, but the latest observations show them forming much closer to the Sun than previously thought. The findings suggest that the magnetic reconfiguration driving space weather begins deeper in the solar atmosphere. Understanding this process isn’t just academic—it helps predict solar storms that can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communications here on Earth. As one researcher quipped, “The Sun doesn’t read textbooks.” Indeed, it keeps rewriting them. With more close passes scheduled, Parker is poised to keep turning solar physics on its head, one U-turn at a time.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Maven stays silent after routine pass behind Mars\" - <a href=\"https://www.marsdaily.com/reports/Maven_stays_silent_after_routine_pass_behind_Mars_999.html\">https://www.marsdaily.com/reports/Maven_stays_silent_after_routine_pass_behind_Mars_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"Micro X ray method reads ancient meteorite impact scars\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Micro_X_ray_method_reads_ancient_meteorite_impact_scars_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Micro_X_ray_method_reads_ancient_meteorite_impact_scars_999.html</a></li>\n    <li>\"NASA's Parker Solar Probe Spies Solar Wind 'U-Turn'\" - <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/NASAs_Parker_Solar_Probe_Spies_Solar_Wind_U_Turn_999.html\">https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/NASAs_Parker_Solar_Probe_Spies_Solar_Wind_U_Turn_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

The European Space Agency (ESA) is now using satellite technology to detect methane leaks from landfill sites, a source responsible for a significant share of global methane emissions. Though methane persists in the atmosphere for far less time than carbon dioxide, it’s over 80 times more potent at trapping heat in the short term, making rapid detection and mitigation crucial.</p>\n<p>Originally developed to monitor oil and gas infrastructure, these satellite systems can now pinpoint methane plumes from landfills with remarkable precision. The data not only helps regulators enforce emissions standards but also enables operators to identify and repair leaks faster. For a country like Canada—home to vast landfills and ambitious climate commitments—this space-based surveillance could become a vital tool in tracking progress toward net-zero goals. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best way to solve Earth-bound problems is to look down from above.</p>\n\n<img src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250827_Starlink_10_11_30.jpg\" alt=\"Falcon 9 rocket launching Starlink satellites from Kennedy Space Center\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<h3>SpaceX Keeps Starlink Constellation Growing with Dual Launches</h3>\n<p>SpaceX kicked off a busy mid-December with not one, but two Falcon 9 missions deploying Starlink satellites within hours of each other. On December 15, the company launched 29 Starlink satellites from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center at 8:11 a.m. EST. Later that same day, another 29 satellites lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station’s Pad 40 at 9:47 p.m. EST. These back-to-back missions mark SpaceX’s 125th orbital launch from LC-39A and its 580th Falcon 9 flight overall—a testament to the rocket’s reliability and reusability.</p>\n<p>The Starlink network now comprises thousands of satellites, providing broadband internet to remote and underserved regions worldwide—including parts of rural Canada where traditional infrastructure remains sparse. While critics raise concerns about orbital congestion and light pollution, the demand for global connectivity continues to drive rapid deployment. For aerospace watchers, these frequent launches have become a hallmark of modern spaceflight: efficient, routine, and relentlessly incremental.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54982970269_2df5b75817_k.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"Rocket Lab Electron rocket launching from Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n<h3>Rocket Lab Delivers JAXA’s Tech Demo to Orbit</h3>\n<p>Rocket Lab successfully launched a Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) technology demonstration satellite on December 13, further cementing its role as a go-to provider for small satellite missions.

According to SpaceNews, the near-miss occurred shortly after China’s Kinetica launch vehicle delivered an experimental cargo spacecraft and a technology demonstration payload into low Earth orbit. While neither agency has confirmed a direct collision risk, the incident underscores the growing challenge of space traffic management in an increasingly congested orbital environment. With over 3,200 satellites launched by SpaceX alone in 2025—and thousands more from global actors—the need for transparent, internationally coordinated tracking and maneuver protocols is more urgent than ever. SpaceX typically shares conjunction data via its automated system with other operators, but cooperation with Chinese entities remains limited due to policy and technical barriers. For spacefaring nations, this event is a not-so-subtle reminder that orbital real estate has become as regulated—and as risky—as a downtown intersection during rush hour.</p>\n\n<h3>Canada’s Modest but Mighty 2025 Satellite Surge</h3>\n<p>While Canada didn’t break any launch records in 2025, it quietly fielded its second-highest satellite deployment tally ever: 12 payloads, trailing only behind the 23 launched in 2023. Most notably, Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) placed the trio of <em>Project Grey Jay</em> satellites into orbit aboard SpaceX’s Transporter-12 mission in January. These smallsats now operate in tight formation over the Arctic, enhancing Canada’s sovereign surveillance capabilities in a region of growing strategic interest. Commercial players also contributed significantly: GHGSat launched four methane-monitoring satellites; Wyvern deployed two hyperspectral Earth observation payloads; and EarthDaily Analytics, Galaxia Mission Systems, and Mission Control each added one satellite to the mix—all搭乘 (hitching rides) on SpaceX’s increasingly reliable Transporter rideshare missions. It’s a pragmatic approach: rather than building expensive dedicated rockets, Canadian firms and government agencies are leveraging cost-effective access to space. As SpaceQ reports, plans are already in motion for over 40 Canadian payloads in 2026, suggesting this “small but steady” strategy is here to stay.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DRDC_grey_jay_pic4_f.jpg?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Grey Jay satellite in cleanroom, part of Canada's Arctic surveillance constellation\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Martian Dust Storms Get Predicted by New Simulation Model</h3>\n<p>Planning a trip to Mars? You might want to check the dust forecast. Researchers using China’s GoMars general circulation model have simulated 50 years of Martian atmospheric activity to better predict the planet’s notorious dust storms. These storms can last weeks or even months, blanketing solar panels, reducing visibility, and threatening surface missions—remember what happened to NASA’s Opportunity rover in 2018. The new model, detailed in a recent report, aims to improve mission safety by forecasting when and where global dust events might erupt. Mars’ thin atmosphere and fine regolith make it prone to massive dust devils and planet-encircling storms, which are hard to anticipate with current tools. While the model originates from Chinese research teams, its data could eventually benefit all Mars missions, including those by NASA, ESA, and future commercial ventures. After all, Martian dust doesn’t care about national borders—it’s an equal-opportunity nuisance. Better forecasting could be the key to keeping rovers rolling and astronauts breathing during humanity’s next giant leap.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.spxdaily.com/images-bg/perseverance-mars-2020-jezero-crater-dust-devils-bg.jpg\" alt=\"Martian dust devils captured by NASA's Perseverance rover in Jezero Crater\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"SpaceX claims close approach to Starlink satellite by payload from Chinese launch\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/spacex-claims-close-approach-to-starlink-satellite-by-payload-from-chinese-launch/\">https://spacenews.com/spacex-claims-close-approach-to-starlink-satellite-by-payload-from-chinese-launch/</a></li>\n    <li>\"12 satellites launched in 2025 with Canadian payloads\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/12-satellites-launched-in-2025-with-canadian-payloads/\">https://spaceq.ca/12-satellites-launched-in-2025-with-canadian-payloads/</a></li>\n    <li>\"GoMars model simulates Martian dust storms to improve mission safety\" - <a href=\"https://www.marsdaily.com/reports/GoMars_model_simulates_Martian_dust_storms_to_improve_mission_safety_999.html\">https://www.marsdaily.com/reports/GoMars_model_simulates_Martian_dust_storms_to_improve_mission_safety_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

On December 17, 2025, Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation Evan Solomon announced a $92 million investment in Phase 1 of the Canadian Quantum Champions Program (CQCP). This initiative is part of a broader $334.4 million, five-year federal commitment to quantum technologies, aimed at positioning Canada as a global leader in fault-tolerant, industrial-scale quantum computing. Four Canadian firms—Anyon Systems (Montreal/Waterloo), Nord Quantique (Sherbrooke), Photonic (Vancouver), and Xanadu Quantum Technologies (Toronto)—will each receive up to $23 million to advance their respective platforms.</p>\n<p>The National Research Council of Canada will also launch a Benchmarking Quantum Platform to independently assess these technologies. National Defence Minister David J. McGuinty emphasized that this isn’t just about computing—it’s about national security, industrial competitiveness, and long-term strategic autonomy. With quantum systems promising breakthroughs in encryption, materials science, and yes, space-based communications (remember QEYnet’s quantum key demonstration?), this investment could ripple across multiple sectors. For a country that helped pioneer quantum theory and AI, it’s a timely reminder that the future is built on more than just ambition—it needs sustained, smart funding.</p>\n\n<h3>Galileo Constellation Grows with First Ariane 6 Ride</h3>\n<p>Europe’s satellite navigation ambitions got a boost on December 17, 2025, with the successful launch of two new Galileo satellites aboard an Ariane 6 rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana. This marked the 14th launch for the Galileo program and, notably, the first time the Ariane 6 has carried Galileo payloads into orbit. The mission reinforces Europe’s push for strategic autonomy in satellite navigation—a crucial capability for everything from civil aviation to emergency response.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2025/12/galileo_launch_14_liftoff/27045192-1-eng-GB/Galileo_launch_14_liftoff_card_full.jpg\" alt=\"Galileo satellites launching on Ariane 6\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\"></p>\n<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) highlighted that this launch strengthens both the resilience and precision of the Galileo constellation, which now includes over two dozen operational satellites. Unlike relying on foreign systems like GPS, Galileo offers Europe independent, high-accuracy positioning—a growing priority in an era of geopolitical uncertainty. Also noteworthy: ESA member states recently committed €100 million to evolve the Ariane 6’s ASTRIS kick stage into a more capable orbital transfer vehicle, suggesting this launcher may play a bigger role in future European missions. While Ariane 6’s debut was long awaited, this mission signals it’s finally settling into its role as Europe’s workhorse for sovereign access to space.</p>\n\n<h3>IoT Meets Orbit: OQ Technology Achieves Direct LEO Connection</h3>\n<p>In a step toward truly seamless global connectivity, Luxembourg-based OQ Technology announced on December 17 that it has successfully linked a commercial IoT chipset directly to one of its low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites—no ground-based gateway required. The connection used software based on 3GPP mobile standards, the same protocols that underpin 4G and 5G networks, suggesting a future where IoT devices could roam seamlessly between terrestrial and satellite networks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nordic-Test.png?fit=1024%2C576&ssl=1\" alt=\"OQ Technology IoT satellite connection test\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\"></p>\n<p>While many satellite IoT services still require specialized hardware or intermediary relays, OQ’s approach could dramatically lower barriers for industries like agriculture, logistics, and asset tracking—especially in remote regions where cellular coverage is nonexistent. The test paves the way for integrating satellite connectivity directly into standard IoT modules, potentially enabling a single device to switch between ground and space networks automatically. It’s a subtle but significant shift: instead of building parallel systems, the industry may be moving toward a unified, global IoT layer. And if the promise holds, your next farm sensor or shipping container tracker might just “call” a satellite the same way your phone calls a cell tower—no extra steps, no extra gear. That’s the kind of elegance engineers appreciate, even if it means more work for the rest of us explaining how it all works at holiday dinners.</p>\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Canadian government makes $92 million investment in quantum tech\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/canadian-government-makes-92-million-investment-in-quantum-tech/\">https://spaceq.ca/canadian-government-makes-92-million-investment-in-quantum-tech/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Galileo’s first Ariane 6 launch strengthens European resilience\" - <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Applications/Satellite_navigation/Galileo_s_first_Ariane_6_launch_strengthens_European_resilience\">https://www.esa.int/Applications/Satellite_navigation/Galileo_s_first_Ariane_6_launch_strengthens_European_resilience</a></li>\n    <li>\"OQ Technology links commercial IoT chipset to LEO satellite\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/oq-technology-links-commercial-iot-chipset-to-leo-satellite/\">https://spacenews.com/oq-technology-links-commercial-iot-chipset-to-leo-satellite/</a></li>\n</ul>",

The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) recently awarded contracts totaling $3.8 million to four Canadian firms—Mission Control Space Services, ABB Inc., Bornea Dynamics Ltd., and Bubble Technology Industries—to develop advanced scientific payloads. Mission Control will build iSPI+ (Intelligent Sensing and Perception in Infrared: Parallelizing Lunar Utility and Science), a thermal-infrared sensor that uses artificial intelligence to autonomously identify scientifically valuable lunar features like “micro cold traps”—tiny, frigid zones that may contain water ice. Dr. Tanya Harrison of Mission Control noted this marks their second contract for the rover, underscoring years of R&D in autonomous space systems.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, ABB is adapting its industrial-grade Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer technology into ALExIS (Autonomous Lunar Exploration Infrared Spectrometer). Designed to analyze the Moon’s regolith across a broad infrared range, ALExIS will help map the distribution of key elements such as oxygen, iron, and water ice. Both instruments aim to reduce reliance on constant Earth-based oversight—a necessity given the rover’s planned 10-year lifespan and brutal operating conditions, including lunar nights plunging to –200°C. The rover, slated for launch no earlier than 2033, will support both astronaut and remote operations from a Canadian control center.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spaceq.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/misson_control-ispi_16x9.jpg?fit=780%2C438&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mission Control's iSPI+ instrument for Canada's Lunar Utility Rover\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Jared Isaacman Confirmed as NASA’s Next Administrator</h3>\n<p>After a drawn-out confirmation process, the U.S. Senate has officially confirmed Jared Isaacman as NASA’s next administrator—a move widely welcomed across the global space community. Known for commanding the Inspiration4 and Polaris Dawn private spaceflight missions, Isaacman brings hands-on astronaut experience and a track record of innovation in commercial space operations. His appointment signals a potential shift toward deeper collaboration between NASA and private aerospace firms, particularly as the agency navigates critical phases of the Artemis program and evolving low-Earth orbit strategy.</p>\n<p>While Isaacman’s exact policy priorities haven’t been detailed yet, his background suggests a strong emphasis on mission efficiency, technological agility, and public-private partnerships. Industry observers note that his leadership could accelerate timelines for lunar infrastructure and Mars preparation, though he’ll also inherit complex challenges: budget constraints, international coordination on the Gateway space station, and the need to maintain NASA’s scientific credibility amid growing commercial influence. For many, the relief isn’t just about who’s in charge—but that a leadership vacancy lasting months is finally over. With human spaceflight entering a pivotal decade, having a confirmed administrator with operational spaceflight experience may prove timely indeed.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54962010038_20923daf20_k.jpg?fit=1024%2C624&ssl=1\" alt=\"Jared Isaacman, newly confirmed NASA administrator\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>VIPER Rover Clears Crucial Stress Test Ahead of Lunar Mission</h3>\n<p>NASA’s VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) has successfully passed a rigorous centrifuge test campaign at Sandia National Laboratories, clearing a major hurdle on its path to the Moon’s South Pole. Weighing in at 1,000 pounds, the rover was subjected to simulated launch and flight stresses to ensure it can endure the journey aboard a commercial lunar lander—currently planned for late 2026. The tests validated VIPER’s structural integrity and confirmed that its sensitive instruments and mobility systems won’t buckle under extreme acceleration forces.</p>\n<p>Once on the Moon, VIPER’s mission is to hunt for water ice in permanently shadowed craters, a critical step toward enabling sustainable human presence. Water could be converted into oxygen for breathing, hydrogen for fuel, and drinking water for future Artemis astronauts. The rover’s ability to operate in frigid, uneven terrain near the lunar pole makes these pre-flight validations especially vital. Engineers now move to final integration and environmental testing phases. If all goes as planned, VIPER will become the first NASA rover to directly prospect for resources that could one day support a lunar base—making its successful stress test not just a technical win, but a symbolic one for the future of in-situ resource utilization.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.spxdaily.com/images-bg/lunar-viper-rover-sandia-superfuge-testing-bg.jpg\" alt=\"NASA's VIPER rover undergoing centrifuge testing at Sandia National Laboratories\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Mission Control awarded contract for iSPI+ instrument on Canada's Lunar Utility Rover\" - <a href=\"https://spaceq.ca/mission-control-awarded-contract-for-ispi-instrument-on-canadas-lunar-utility-rover/\">https://spaceq.ca/mission-control-awarded-contract-for-ispi-instrument-on-canadas-lunar-utility-rover/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Space community celebrates Isaacman confirmation\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/space-community-celebrates-isaacman-confirmation/\">https://spacenews.com/space-community-celebrates-isaacman-confirmation/</a></li>\n    <li>\"Sandia centrifuge campaign clears NASA VIPER rover for lunar launch\" - <a href=\"https://www.moondaily.com/reports/Sandia_centrifuge_campaign_clears_NASA_VIPER_rover_for_lunar_launch_999.html\">https://www.moondaily.com/reports/Sandia_centrifuge_campaign_clears_NASA_VIPER_rover_for_lunar_launch_999.html</a></li>\n</ul>",

The decision follows an unexpected interruption in helium flow within the rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS), observed overnight on Saturday, February 21, 2026. This issue with the ICPS has prompted teams to review data and prepare contingency measures, effectively ruling out the targeted March launch window and pushing the mission toward a possible April liftoff if the rollback is confirmed. Pre-rollback work is already underway, including the removal of pad access platforms installed yesterday. These platforms are subject to wind constraints and cannot be removed during high winds, which are forecasted for tomorrow. Following a successful second Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), NASA took the unusual step of announcing a target launch date of March 6 for Artemis II—despite traditionally waiting until the completion of the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) to set firm dates. Less than 24 hours later, that date became non-viable after an overnight helium flow anomaly was noted. Discover more NASA merchandise Chinese spaceflight analysis Space exploration books NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman addressed the development in a statement, emphasizing the troubleshooting efforts underway. “After overnight data showed an interruption in helium flow in the SLS interim cryogenic propulsion stage, teams are troubleshooting and preparing for a likely rollback of Artemis II to the VAB,” Isaacman said. “This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window.” Notably, NSF was hearing rumors of a potential vehicle issue that could result in a rollback on Saturday morning. Less than an hour later, NASA and Isaacman published a statement online—an impressive sign of the Administrator’s commitment to increasing transparency at the agency. The ICPS, or Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, is effectively the SLS rocket’s upper stage. Derived from the Delta IV rocket’s second stage and adapted for Artemis missions, it uses liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) as propellants to provide the necessary thrust after core stage burnout, enabling the Orion spacecraft to reach lunar orbit insertion trajectories. Helium plays a vital role in this system. Stored in onboard bottles, it purges the engines of residual gases and pressurizes the LH2 and LOX tanks during ascent. According to Isaacman, the ICPS helium system performed flawlessly during the first two Wet Dress Rehearsals (WDRs), which are full-scale fueling simulations conducted at Launch Pad 39B. The second WDR, in particular, proceeded according to plan with no indications of helium issues. “The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2,” he noted. The problem emerged during a routine repressurization operation last evening, catching teams off guard. “This was an unexpected development during routine helium flow operations last evening. The teams were up all night assessing the situation,” Isaacman added. Engineers are investigating potential causes, drawing parallels to a similar failure signature encountered during the Artemis I uncrewed mission in 2022. Possible faults include a final filter on the umbilical connection between ground systems and the vehicle, a failed quick-disconnect (QD) umbilical interface—where issues have been noted before—or a malfunctioning check valve onboard the rocket. Corrective measures were implemented post-Artemis I to reduce such risks for Artemis II, but the recurrence underscores the challenges of cryogenic systems in extreme environments. Isaacman also explained why a rollback is likely: remediation for any of these issues requires access only available in the VAB, which features numerous platform levels that rotate into place around the stack. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” he confirmed. See Also Artemis Section L2 Artemis Click here to Join L2 The vehicle remains in a safe configuration, relying on ground-based environmental control systems (ECS) for engine purging instead of the onboard helium supply. This potential rollback echoes delays in previous Artemis preparations, where weather, technical glitches, and supply chain issues have repeatedly extended timelines. The March window, already tight, now appears off the table, with April emerging as the next viable opportunity—assuming swift resolution. “A rollback would mean NASA will not launch Artemis II in the March launch window,” NASA noted. “However, the quick preparations enable NASA to potentially preserve the April launch window if a rollback is required, pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.” NASA is set to provide another update during the coming week, which will also address requirements for a rollback, including resolution and return to the pad. The latter may require at least a tanking test or mini-WDR to confirm that the trip up and down the crawlerway did not affect systems such as the LH2 tail service mast umbilical (TSMU), which necessitated WDR2.

[German defense firm said to be weighing bid for Mynaric](https://spacenews.com/german-defense-firm-said-to-be-weighing-bid-for-mynaric/)\n\n**Source:** SpaceNews | **Date:** February 22, 2026 | **Length:** 426 words\n\n![Featured Image](https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FocqgZhaUAECh_z-scaled.jpeg)\n\nWASHINGTON — Rheinmetall, Germany’s largest defense contractor, is weighing a potential acquisition of Munich-based laser communications terminal maker Mynaric, a move that could upend Rocket Lab’s previously announced plan to buy the company. German media first reported Rheinmetall’s interest, citing a desire to keep critical aerospace and laser communications technology under German and European control. Rheinmetall has not commented publicly. The reports come as Germany and other European nations intensify scrutiny of foreign takeovers involving sensitive defense technologies. Rocket Lab, the Long Beach, Calif.-based launch services provider and satellite manufacturer, said in March it planned to acquire Mynaric for roughly $150 million, subject to approval by German authorities under foreign direct investment rules. Nearly a year later, regulators have yet to sign off, and the deal has drawn heightened political attention as Europe accelerates efforts to build domestic space and defense capacity. The backdrop is Germany’s sharp increase in defense spending following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing uncertainty about long-term U.S. security commitments. Across Europe, governments are pairing higher defense budgets with industrial policies aimed at strengthening “sovereign” technological capabilities. Laser communications terminals fall squarely into that category. Mynaric develops optical terminals that transmit data between satellites using laser links, a technology viewed as essential for next-generation defense and commercial constellations. Compared with traditional radio-frequency systems, laser links can move data at higher rates and with greater resistance to interference, making them attractive for military networks.

For Rocket Lab, acquiring Mynaric would secure access to a critical subsystem and expand its footprint in Europe. The company has been building out its satellite manufacturing business alongside its launch operations and has positioned itself as an end-to-end provider of space services. Control over laser communications technology would reduce reliance on external suppliers for satellites destined for U.S. government and allied customers. Mynaric, for its part, has faced financial strains in recent years as it scaled production and worked through manufacturing setbacks. Despite those challenges, its technology has become strategically significant as Western governments push to deploy proliferated constellations in low Earth orbit.\n\n---\n\n## 3. [NASA preparing for Artemis 2 rollback to fix upper stage problem](https://spacenews.com/nasa-preparing-for-artemis-2-rollback-to-fix-upper-stage-problem/)\n\n**Source:** SpaceNews | **Date:** February 21, 2026 | **Length:** 584 words\n\n![Featured Image](https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/art2-20260202.jpeg)\n\nUpdated 12:15 p.m. Eastern with additional comments from Isaacman. WASHINGTON — Just 24 hours after setting a March 6 launch date for the Artemis 2 mission, NASA announced Feb. 21 that a problem with the Space Launch System upper stage will delay the launch. In a brief statement , NASA said it was preparing to roll the SLS back from Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center to the Vehicle Assembly Building after engineers found that helium flow in the rocket’s upper stage had been interrupted. Helium is used to pressurize tanks in the stage, formally known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. NASA had not reported any issues with helium flow or tank pressurization during a second wet dress rehearsal that concluded late Feb. 19. NASA initially said it had not yet made a final decision to roll the vehicle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, or VAB, and was studying options to fix the problem at the pad as well as inside the VAB. However, in a social media post , NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman called a rollback “likely.” Subscribe Today Get unlimited access to SpaceNews.com and our digital magazine with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription. Checkout Now Discounted Access Learn more about savings available for academic, government and military readers on SpaceNews subscriptions. Save on SpaceNews In a subsequent post , Isaacman said that while several potential causes for the problem, also seen during Artemis 1, were being considered, NASA would proceed with a rollback. \"Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,\" he stated. While studying repair options, workers began preparing for a potential rollback. That includes disassembling temporary work platforms that had just been installed at the launch pad for tasks such as retesting the rocket’s flight termination system. That work could not wait until Feb. 22, the agency said, because of high winds forecast that day. The announcement came a day after agency officials said at a briefing that they were working toward launching Artemis 2 as soon as March 6 , the first day of the next launch period for the mission. That opportunity runs through March 11. The upper stage problem and possible rollback “will almost assuredly impact the March launch window,” NASA said. Isaacman stated that the rollback \"will take the March launch window out of consideration.\" At the Feb. 20 briefing, NASA cautioned that work remained to prepare Artemis 2 for a March launch, including pad activities and a multiday flight readiness review. “But assuming that happens, it puts us in a very good position to target March 6,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for exploration systems development. “I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” added John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Artemis 2 mission management team. “It’s out there at the pad. It’s going to be there at the pad until we go fly.” If NASA is unable to launch Artemis 2 in March, the next launch window runs from April 1 to 6. Another window opens April 30, although NASA has not disclosed additional launch opportunities beyond the end of April. \"I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,\" Isaacman said, but noted there were \"many setbacks\" during the Apollo program before landing people on the moon in 1969.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

The Starlink 6-104 mission added another 28 broadband internet satellites to SpaceX’s growing low Earth orbit constellation of more than 9,700 satellites. Liftoff from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station happened at 10:47 p.m. EST (0347 UTC). The Falcon 9 rocket flew on a south-easterly trajectory upon leaving the pad. The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a greater than 95 percent chance for favorable weather during liftoff, citing no specific meteorological concerns. The 33rd flight of Falcon 9 booster 1067 came about 2.5 months after its previous launch in early December. Its previous missions include four flights for NASA, the European Commission’s Galileo L13, and 20 batches of Starlink satellites. Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1067 landed on the droneship, ‘A Shortfall of Gravitas,’ positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. This was the 143rd landing on this vessel and the 575th booster landing to date for SpaceX.\n\n### Additional Images\n\n![Image 1](http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260221_Starlink_6-104_AB-1.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n## 5. [NASA&#8217;s Artemis 2 rocket hit by new problem expected to bump moonshot into early April](https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/21/nasas-artemis-2-rocket-hit-by-new-problem-expected-to-bump-moonshot-into-early-april/)\n\n**Source:** Spaceflight Now | **Date:** February 21, 2026 | **Length:** 634 words\n\n![Featured Image](http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260221-SLS_pad_shot_ICPS.jpeg)\n\nEngineers ran into problems repressurizing the Artemis 2 moon rocket’s upper stage helium tanks overnight Friday, a problem that will require rolling the huge rocket off the launch pad and back to its processing hangar for troubleshooting. The work will push the already delayed mission from March to at least early April, officials said Saturday. Pressurized helium is used to push propellants to rocket engines for ignition and to purge various fuel lines to clear them out before propellants flow. It’s not yet known what might be preventing helium to flow back into the SLS rocket’s upper stage following a successful countdown rehearsal test that ended Thursday. “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building),” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a post on the social media platform X. “We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration.” As an update to my earlier post. – The ICPS helium bottles are used to purge the engines, as well as for LH2 and LOX tank pressurization. The systems did work correctly during WDR1 and WDR2. – Last evening, the team was unable to get helium flow through the vehicle. This… https://t.co/Qte3nEXwQb — NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman (@NASAAdmin) February 21, 2026 The Artemis 2 mission aims to send four astronauts – Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen – on a flight around the far side of the moon and back to thoroughly test the agency’s Orion deep space capsule to help clear the way for a lunar landing mission, Artemis 3, in 2028. Because of the ever-changing positions of the Earth and moon, and associated changes in lighting and other factors, only a handful of launch opportunities are available each month that meet the Artemis 2 mission requirements. The current launch period ends on March 11. The available launch dates next month are April 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Wiseman, Glover, Koch and Hansen originally hoped to launch early this month, but hydrogen leaks detected during an initial “wet dress countdown” rehearsal ultimately pushed the flight to March. NASA completed a second fueling test and countdown Thursday, loading the Space Launch System rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel while working through the steps that will be needed to actually launch the huge rocket on the long-awaited mission. The test went well, there were no fuel leaks like the ones that derailed plans for a launch earlier this month. Managers said Friday the team would press ahead for a launch attempt on March 6 to send Wiseman and his crewmates to the moon. Hoping for the best, the astronauts went into pre-flight medical quarantine at the Johnson Space Center Friday evening and planned to fly to the Kennedy Space Center on March 1 to prepare for launch. They now will leave quarantine to await developments. “I understand people are disappointed by this development,” Isaacman said. “That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor. During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks. “There are many differences between the 1960s and today, and expectations should rightfully be high after the time and expense invested in this program. “I will say again, the President created Artemis as a program that will far surpass what America achieved during Apollo. We will return in the years ahead, we will build a Moon base, and undertake what should be continuous missions to and from the lunar environment. Where we begin with this architecture and flight rate is not where it will end.”\n\n### Additional Images\n\n![Image 1](http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260219_Artemis-II_WDR-2_clock.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n*End Of Articles*\n\nEvents from past 24 hours: # Space Events This Week\n\n*Generated on February 22, 2026 at 1:01 PM UTC*\n\nNo events scheduled this week.\n\n---\n\n*End of Space Events Digest*\n\nSpaceQ articles from past 24 hours: # SpaceQ Articles\n\n*Generated on February 22, 2026 at 1:01 PM UTC*\n\n**Total Articles:** 1\n\n---\n\n## 1.

NASA is preparing to potentially move the Artemis 2 rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building due to a helium flow issue. NASA said it noticed that the flow of helium to the Space Launch System (rocket's) interim cryogenic propulsion stage was interrupted overnight. NASA was reviewing the data ahead of a possible roll back of the massive rocket to the Vehicle Assembly Building. \"Teams are actively reviewing data, and taking steps to enable rollback positions for NASA to address the issue as soon as possible while engineers determine the best path forward. In order to protect for troubleshooting options at both Pad B and the VAB, teams are making preparations to remove the pad access platforms installed yesterday, which have wind-driven constraints and cannot be removed during high winds, which are forecasted for tomorrow.\" NASA said that \"this will almost assuredly impact the March launch window.\" More to come.\n\n---\n\n*End of SpaceQ Articles*\n\n\nYesterday's post citations (DO NOT reuse these sources): <h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul><li>No citations found</li></ul>\nNote: You may reference the same events if they're ongoing, but must find new source articles about them.\n\n## Available Images\n- Use images from the articles, blogs, reports, and events provided in the source materials\n- Extract image URLs from the markdown content\n- Prioritize high-quality, relevant images that illustrate the stories\n- If no suitable images are available for any story, it's acceptable to omit images entirely\n\n## Story Selection Process\nSelect THREE stories using this priority system:\n\n**Priority 1 - Breaking News:**\n- Unscheduled launches, rocket explosions, satellite re-entries, mission failures\n- Major accidents or anomalies\n- If discussing accidents/damage: be respectful, factual, avoid speculation\n- Only select breaking news if it occurred in the past 24 hours\n\n**Priority 2 - Regional Interest (Max 1 Story):**\n- Canadian space projects or missions\n- Canadian involvement in international space missions\n- Canadian commercial launch industry news\n- Canadian astronauts or space agencies\n- LIMIT: Maximum ONE story from this category\n\n**Priority 3 - Major Programs (in order of priority):**\n1.

Now, Rheinmetall’s potential counteroffer could keep the technology firmly under European sovereignty.</p>\n<p>For Canada and other NATO allies, the outcome matters: laser communications are becoming essential for next-generation defence constellations. If Europe opts for domestic control, it may spur similar policies elsewhere—reshaping how Western nations collaborate on secure space infrastructure in an increasingly fragmented global landscape.</p>\n<img src=\"https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FocqgZhaUAECh_z-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Mynaric laser communication terminal undergoing testing\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"NASA prepares for likely rollback of SLS, delaying Artemis II to April\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2026/02/nasa-rollback-sls-delaying-artemis-april/\">https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2026/02/nasa-rollback-sls-delaying-artemis-april/</a></li>\n    <li>\"SpaceX’s most-flown Falcon booster launches on record 33rd flight\" - <a href=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/21/live-coverage-spacexs-most-flown-falcon-booster-to-launch-on-record-33rd-flight/\">https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/21/live-coverage-spacexs-most-flown-falcon-booster-to-launch-on-record-33rd-flight/</a></li>\n    <li>\"German defense firm said to be weighing bid for Mynaric\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/german-defense-firm-said-to-be-weighing-bid-for-mynaric/\">https://spacenews.com/german-defense-firm-said-to-be-weighing-bid-for-mynaric/</a></li>\n</ul>",

The reason? An unexpected interruption in helium flow within the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS)—the upper stage derived from the Delta IV—detected during routine operations on the evening of February 21.</p>\n<p>Helium is critical for purging engine lines and pressurizing the liquid hydrogen and oxygen tanks during flight. Although the system performed flawlessly during two recent Wet Dress Rehearsals, this new anomaly has halted final launch preparations. According to NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman, “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB.” As a result, engineers have begun removing newly installed pad access platforms ahead of forecasted high winds on February 22—work that must be completed before any rollback can proceed.</p>\n<p>With the March 6–11 launch window now “almost assuredly” off the table, attention shifts to the next viable opportunity: April 1–6, 2026. The mission, which aims to send four astronauts—including Canadian Jeremy Hansen—on a lunar flyby, remains a cornerstone of NASA’s return-to-the-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JE1eAM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">Moon</a> programme. While disappointing, Isaacman reminded the public that even Apollo faced numerous setbacks before success.</p>\n<img src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260221-SLS_pad_shot_ICPS.jpeg\" alt=\"Close-up of the SLS rocket's upper stage at Launch Pad 39B\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>SpaceX Sets New Reusability Milestone with 33rd Booster Flight</h3>\n<p>While NASA grapples with delays, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4oREo7N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">SpaceX</a> quietly notched another record in the reusability playbook. On February 21, 2026 at 10:47 p.m. EST, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/498VWI9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">Falcon 9</a> booster B1067 launched for its 33rd time—the most of any orbital-class rocket booster in history. The flight, designated Starlink 6-104, delivered 28 more broadband satellites to low <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JLwvlp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">Earth</a> orbit from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p>\n<p>Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1067 touched down on the droneship <em>A Shortfall of Gravitas</em> in the Atlantic Ocean, marking SpaceX’s 575th successful booster landing overall. This particular booster’s resume includes four NASA missions, the European Commission’s Galileo L13 satellite, and 20 previous Starlink batches. With SpaceX now certifying boosters for up to 40 flights, B1067 still has room to fly.</p>\n<p>The mission further expands SpaceX’s Starlink constellation, which now exceeds 9,700 satellites. While routine by SpaceX standards, this flight underscores the dramatic transformation in launch economics driven by reusability—a stark contrast to the bespoke, single-use approach of SLS.</p>\n<img src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260221_Starlink_6-104_MC-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Falcon 9 launching Starlink satellites with booster B1067 on its 33rd flight\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>European Defence Tensions Rise Over Mynaric Acquisition Battle</h3>\n<p>In a behind-the-scenes drama with geopolitical stakes, German defence giant Rheinmetall is reportedly weighing a bid to acquire Mynaric, a Munich-based maker of laser communications terminals—potentially derailing Rocket Lab’s planned $150 million purchase announced nearly a year ago. The move reflects growing European anxiety over foreign control of critical space technologies, particularly in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and questions about long-term U.S. security commitments.</p>\n<p>Mynaric’s CONDOR Mk3 optical terminals enable high-speed, secure data transfer between satellites using laser links—technology now flying on U.S. Space Development Agency satellites for missile tracking and resilient military communications. While Rocket Lab, a U.S.-New Zealand company, sees the acquisition as a way to vertically integrate its satellite manufacturing, German regulators have yet to approve the deal under foreign investment rules. Now, Rheinmetall’s potential counteroffer could keep the technology firmly under European sovereignty.</p>\n<p>For Canada and other NATO allies, the outcome matters: laser communications are becoming essential for next-generation defence constellations. If Europe opts for domestic control, it may spur similar policies elsewhere—reshaping how Western nations collaborate on secure space infrastructure in an increasingly fragmented global landscape.</p>\n<img src=\"https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FocqgZhaUAECh_z-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Mynaric laser communication terminal undergoing testing\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"NASA prepares for likely rollback of SLS, delaying Artemis II to April\" - <a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2026/02/nasa-rollback-sls-delaying-artemis-april/\">https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2026/02/nasa-rollback-sls-delaying-artemis-april/</a></li>\n    <li>\"SpaceX’s most-flown Falcon booster launches on record 33rd flight\" - <a href=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/21/live-coverage-spacexs-most-flown-falcon-booster-to-launch-on-record-33rd-flight/\">https://spaceflightnow.com/2026/02/21/live-coverage-spacexs-most-flown-falcon-booster-to-launch-on-record-33rd-flight/</a></li>\n    <li>\"German defense firm said to be weighing bid for Mynaric\" - <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/german-defense-firm-said-to-be-weighing-bid-for-mynaric/\">https://spacenews.com/german-defense-firm-said-to-be-weighing-bid-for-mynaric/</a></li>\n</ul>",

The reason? An unexpected interruption in helium flow within the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS)—the upper stage derived from the Delta IV—detected during routine operations on the evening of February 21.</p>\n<p>Helium is critical for purging engine lines and pressurizing the liquid hydrogen and oxygen tanks during flight. Although the system performed flawlessly during two recent Wet Dress Rehearsals, this new anomaly has halted final launch preparations. According to NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman, “Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB.” As a result, engineers have begun removing newly installed pad access platforms ahead of forecasted high winds on February 22—work that must be completed before any rollback can proceed.</p>\n<p>With the March 6–11 launch window now “almost assuredly” off the table, attention shifts to the next viable opportunity: April 1–6, 2026. The mission, which aims to send four astronauts—including Canadian Jeremy Hansen—on a lunar flyby, remains a cornerstone of NASA’s return-to-the-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JE1eAM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">Moon</a> programme. While disappointing, Isaacman reminded the public that even Apollo faced numerous setbacks before success.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260221-SLS_pad_shot_ICPS.jpeg\" alt=\"Close-up of the SLS rocket's upper stage at Launch Pad 39B\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\"></p>\n<h3>SpaceX Sets New Reusability Milestone with 33rd Booster Flight</h3>\n<p>While NASA grapples with delays, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4oREo7N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">SpaceX</a> quietly notched another record in the reusability playbook. On February 21, 2026 at 10:47 p.m. EST, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/498VWI9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">Falcon 9</a> booster B1067 launched for its 33rd time—the most of any orbital-class rocket booster in history. The flight, designated Starlink 6-104, delivered 28 more broadband satellites to low <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JLwvlp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" ;\">Earth</a> orbit from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p>\n<p>Nearly 8.5 minutes after liftoff, B1067 touched down on the droneship <em>A Shortfall of Gravitas</em> in the Atlantic Ocean, marking SpaceX’s 575th successful booster landing overall. This particular booster’s resume includes four NASA missions, the European Commission’s Galileo L13 satellite, and 20 previous Starlink batches. With SpaceX now certifying boosters for up to 40 flights, B1067 still has room to fly.</p>\n<p>The mission further expands SpaceX’s Starlink constellation, which now exceeds 9,700 satellites. While routine by SpaceX standards, this flight underscores the dramatic transformation in launch economics driven by reusability—a stark contrast to the bespoke, single-use approach of SLS.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260221_Starlink_6-104_MC-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Falcon 9 launching Starlink satellites with booster B1067 on its 33rd flight\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\"></p>\n<h3>European Defence Tensions Rise Over Mynaric Acquisition Battle</h3>\n<p>In a behind-the-scenes drama with geopolitical stakes, German defence giant Rheinmetall is reportedly weighing a bid to acquire Mynaric, a Munich-based maker of laser communications terminals—potentially derailing Rocket Lab’s planned $150 million purchase announced nearly a year ago. The move reflects growing European anxiety over foreign control of critical space technologies, particularly in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and questions about long-term U.S. security commitments.</p>\n<p>Mynaric’s CONDOR Mk3 optical terminals enable high-speed, secure data transfer between satellites using laser links—technology now flying on U.S. Space Development Agency satellites for missile tracking and resilient military communications. While Rocket Lab, a U.S.-New Zealand company, sees the acquisition as a way to vertically integrate its satellite manufacturing, German regulators have yet to approve the deal under foreign investment rules. Now, Rheinmetall’s potential counteroffer could keep the technology firmly under European sovereignty.</p>\n<p>For Canada and other NATO allies, the outcome matters: laser communications are becoming essential for next-generation defence constellations. If Europe opts for domestic control, it may spur similar policies elsewhere—reshaping how Western nations collaborate on secure space infrastructure in an increasingly fragmented global landscape.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FocqgZhaUAECh_z-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Mynaric laser communication terminal undergoing testing\" style=\"display:block;

Write naturally without forcing stereotypes.\n\n## TODAY'S DATE AND TEMPORAL ACCURACY - CRITICAL\n- TODAY'S DATE: - TODAY'S DATE AND TIME: {{ $now.toFormat('MMMM d, yyyy \\'at\\' h:mm a') }} EST\n- Articles may discuss FUTURE events - do NOT report them as already completed\n- Use proper tense:\n  - Past tense: \"SpaceX launched...\" (for completed events)\n  - Future tense: \"SpaceX is scheduled to launch...\" or \"will launch...\" (for upcoming events)\n- If an article discusses a scheduled launch/event, clearly state it has NOT happened yet\n- Include specific dates/times for future events when available\n- VERIFY: Does the article say it happened, or that it WILL happen?\n- When uncertain about timing, check for keywords: \"scheduled\", \"planned\", \"upcoming\", \"will\", \"expected to\"\n\n## Format Requirements\n- Use HTML5 tags ONLY: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <strong>, <em>, <ul>, <li>, <a>, <img>\n- DO NOT set: font-family, max-width, font-size, or any CSS styling\n- Images: Use <img src=\"URL\" alt=\"description\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n## Writing Style\n- Clear and concise - easy to read\n- Informative - convey interesting facts accurately\n- Do not make assumptions or speculate\n- Add subtle humor where appropriate\n- Maintain a conversational but professional tone\n\n## Canadian Perspective\n- Highlight Canadian connections when they exist (missions, technology, astronauts, companies)\n- Use Canadian spelling (favour, colour, centre, programme)\n- Include context relevant to Canadian readers where appropriate\n- Don't force it - only mention Canada when naturally relevant\n\n## Source Materials (Past 24 Hours Only)\nArticles from past 24 hours: {{ $node[\"Article Final Prep\"].json.combined_article_markdown }}\nEvents from past 24 hours: {{ $node[\"Event Final Prep\"].json.combined_events_markdown }}\nSpaceQ articles from past 24 hours: {{ $node[\"SpaceQ Final Prep\"].json.combined_spaceq_markdown }}\n\nYesterday's post citations (DO NOT reuse these sources): {{ $json.text }}\nNote: You may reference the same events if they're ongoing, but must find new source articles about them.\n\n## Available Images\n- Use images from the articles, blogs, reports, and events provided in the source materials\n- Extract image URLs from the markdown content\n- Prioritize high-quality, relevant images that illustrate the stories\n- If no suitable images are available for any story, it's acceptable to omit images entirely\n\n## Story Selection Process\nSelect THREE stories using this priority system:\n\n**Priority 1 - Breaking News:**\n- Unscheduled launches, rocket explosions, satellite re-entries, mission failures\n- Major accidents or anomalies\n- If discussing accidents/damage: be respectful, factual, avoid speculation\n- Only select breaking news if it occurred in the past 24 hours\n\n**Priority 2 - Regional Interest (Max 1 Story):**\n- Canadian space projects or missions\n- Canadian involvement in international space missions\n- Canadian commercial launch industry news\n- Canadian astronauts or space agencies\n- LIMIT: Maximum ONE story from this category\n\n**Priority 3 - Major Programs (in order of priority):**\n1. SpaceX Starship/Starbase missions or news\n2. Artemis/Orion programme updates\n3. Rocket Lab missions or news\n4. Blue Origin missions or news\n5. Other major launch providers\n\n**Priority 4 - General Interest:**\n- Stories that would interest aerospace enthusiasts\n- Technical innovations or breakthroughs\n- First-time achievements or milestones\n- Industry developments or partnerships\n- Scientific discoveries from space missions\n\n**Fallback:**\nIf none of the above apply, choose the three most interesting or significant stories from the available sources.\n\n## Article Structure\n\n**Header Image:**\n- Use image from first story (if available)\n- If not available, use image from second story\n- If not available, use image from third story\n- If no images available, omit header image entirely\n- Center the image using: <img src=\"URL\" alt=\"description\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n\n**Title:**\n- Create one <h1> heading that ties together the theme of all three stories\n- Format: <h1>Your Creative Title Here</h1>\n- Make it engaging and reflective of the day's aerospace developments\n\n**Story Format:**\n- Each story gets its own <h3> subheading\n- Write 150-300 words per story (this is a flexible range, not a strict requirement)\n- Include relevant images within each story section if available\n- Use format: <img src=\"URL\" alt=\"description\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\">\n- Be factual - cite specific dates, times, numbers, and details from sources\n- Include mission names, vehicle names, or company names when available\n- Connect stories thematically where relevant\n- Clearly distinguish between completed events and scheduled/upcoming events\n\n**Citations Section:**\nAt the end, add:\n<h3>Citations</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\"Article Title\" - <a href=\"full_url\">full_url</a></li>\n    <li>\"Article Title\" - <a href=\"full_url\">full_url</a></li>\n    <li>\"Article Title\" - <a href=\"full_url\">full_url</a></li>\n</ul>\n\nInclude ALL sources referenced in your post.\n\n## Content Guidelines\n- Use specific dates, times, and numbers from source material\n- Include mission names, vehicle names, launch providers, and specific details\n- Cite tweets or social media posts when referencing them\n- Each story should be 200-500 words (flexible guideline)\n- Connect related stories thematically when possible\n- Maintain factual accuracy - no speculation or assumptions\n- Distinguish clearly between past events (already happened) and scheduled/upcoming events (will happen)\n- Never report future events as if they've already occurred\n- For scheduled launches: include the planned date/time and use future tense\n\n## Final Checks\n- Did you avoid reusing yesterday's source articles?\n- Did you include 3 distinct stories?\n- Did you limit Priority 2 (Regional Interest) stories to MAX 1?\n- Is each story approximately 200-500 words?\n- Are all citations present and correctly formatted?\n- Are images centered with proper HTML format?\n- Is all HTML valid (no CSS styling except image centering)?\n- Does the title tie the three stories together thematically?\n- Did you use Canadian spelling where appropriate?\n- Did you correctly distinguish between completed and upcoming events?\n- Did you verify the timing of all events mentioned?\n\n## Output Format\nReturn ONLY the HTML article content with no preamble, explanations, or markdown code blocks.\nStart directly with the header image (if available) and <h1> title, followed by the three stories and citations.\n\nBegin writing the daily aerospace blog post now.",
