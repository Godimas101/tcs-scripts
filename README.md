# 🛠️ TCS Scripts - The Automation Toolbox

> **"Why do it manually when you can over-engineer it?"** — Every developer ever

## What Lives Here?

The code nodes that power **The Canadian Space** automation. These are the sticks of glue holding the magic together behind the scenes — JavaScript functions, data transformers, and workflow logic that make n8n workflows actually work.

## The Workflows

Each folder contains the code nodes and scripts for a specific Canadian Space content stream:

### 📰 Content Workflows
- **canada-from-orbit/** - Canadian space news aggregation and curation
- **the-daily-broadcast/** - Daily space news roundup
- **the-spacex-report/** - SpaceX-focused coverage and updates
- **the-commercial-space/** - Commercial space industry news
- **the-nasa-overview/** - NASA missions and developments
- **rocketlab-roundup/** - Rocket Lab news and launches

### 📱 Social & Publishing
- **social-posts/** - Social media content generation and distribution
- **llm-usage-tracker/** - AI API usage monitoring and cost tracking

### 🔧 Infrastructure
- **workflow-backup/** - Automated n8n workflow backup system (backs itself up!)
  - Daily backups to private GitHub repo
  - Complete setup documentation and examples

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the script you want
3. Read the README (yes, actually read it)
4. Profit??? 📈

## Philosophy

> "If you have to do it twice, automate it. If you have to automate it, over-engineer it. If you over-engineer it, write docs about it."

We believe in:
- ✅ Automation over repetition
- ✅ Documentation over confusion
- ✅ Version control over panic
- ✅ Testing in production (just kidding... mostly)
