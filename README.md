# 🛠️ TCS Scripts - The Automation Toolbox

> **"Why do it manually when you can over-engineer it?"** — Every developer ever

## What Lives Here?

Scripts, tools, and automation magic that keep **The Canadian Space** running smoothly. This is where we store the code that makes robots do our bidding.

## Featured Attractions

### 🔄 Workflow Backup System (`workflow-backup/`)

The crown jewel of meta-automation:

- **Backs up n8n workflows** to a private GitHub repo
- **Runs daily at 2 AM** because that's when the magic happens
- **Backs itself up** (yes, the backup system backs itself up — mind blown 🤯)
- **Handles 13 workflows** like a champ

**The Script That Started It All:**
```
workflow-backup/
├── workflow_backup_automation.json  ← Import this into n8n
├── README.md                        ← Complete documentation

├── CHANGELOG.md                     ← Version history
└── .env.example                     ← Security template

## Philosophy

> "If you have to do it twice, automate it. If you have to automate it, over-engineer it. If you over-engineer it, write docs about it."

We believe in:
- ✅ Automation over repetition
- ✅ Documentation over confusion
- ✅ Version control over panic
- ✅ Testing in production (just kidding... mostly)
